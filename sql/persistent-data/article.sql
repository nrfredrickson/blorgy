by Alan McLeod<p> 

You might be amazed at how much there is to read and learn about beer, breweries and brewing on line today. Through the combined efforts of professional writers, amateur hobbyists, brewers and beer stores, there is hardly an pub, ale or lager out there that has gone unreviewed or unphotographed, whether it is on a group review site, bulletin board or blog. This includes nearly all the craft beers and specialty imports available across the Great Lakes region. And as the Internet matures along with the craft beer industry, we are seeing more and more ways for dedicated beer geeks to get involved the brew they love.<p>

The two kings of the beer review site world are clearly the Beer Advocate and RateBeer. Both web sites started in 2000 and each has thousands of reviewers, hundreds of thousands of reviews as well as millions of readers visits each year. As a first source of information on any beer you might encounter on your travels, both these web services provide a selection of views by people with a great variety of tastes and experience. They also provide pub travel and beer shopping information, and reviews. The Beer Community over at RealBeer.com provides a similar service.<p>

These sites are a great way to find out what people think of a beer, but many people think different things about each of those beers, and once you have gotten into the beer-geek and of the opinion spectrum, your taste is likely as unique as anyone else''s. In other words, results may vary.  Another great service these sites provide is a cataloging of each brewer''s brands, past and present, along with details like which ones are kegged and which are bottled, special brewing or ingredient detail, which ones will excite yours senses, and will ones will knock you off your bar stool.<p>

Similar to these vast international communities of beery babble, local web-based bulletin boards provide the sort of focus, both on topic and even membership, that global services just can''t match. Toronto''s Bar Towel is a great example of a group board focused on one local community. The members meet each other off-line, shop at the same shops, visit the same pubs and collectively create a far more detailed view of their city than what is available on a site that seek to capture a vision of the entire world of beer.<p>

I''ve been writing about beer for about three years now at my website, A Good Beer Blog. Blogs like mine differ from these large, busy sites as they are usually the work of one or a few people, writing just from there own point of view. Being blogs, there is a lot of cut and paste as well as a lot of repetition in that cutting and pasting, but the good ones have plenty that is new. My favorite has to be Knut of Norway''s beer blog [http://beerblog.motime.com.] Knut travels all over Europe and takes us along to the pubs and breweries he visits.  For more, check out The Beer Siteâs blog directory for a good selection [http://www.thebrewsite.com/reading_list.php.]
There are a number of sites out there run by the professional writers, too. The most active in the Great Lakes region would have to be beer and whisky writer Lew Bryson, of Pennsylvania. His website is a massive resource for what is going on the industry domestically as well as around the world. He even uses the internet to keep his useful set of books updated, a very clever move. While beer papers (www.brewingnews.com) have had a web presence for some time, traditional newspapers have also gotten into the act, paying staff to run regular beer columns like the Beer Buddies of Rochester''s Democrat and Chronicle [http://www.democratandchronicle.com], or the Beer Man of The Post-Crescent of Wisconsin [http://pcbeerman.blogspot.com/2006_04_01_pcbeerman_archive.html] or the Toronto Star''s Josh Rubin [http://www.thestar.com].  <p>

<h5>Brew It Or Buy It</h5>

Even though the internet is well over a decade old now, beer shopping on-line has yet to truly take off. This is, when you think of it, not much different from the buying of many other tangible products--like sofas and bulk cat food--which, once upon a time, was supposed shut malls and grocery chains throughout the western world.  Some shops are out there like the venerable Londonâs Pittfield Beer Shop [http://www.pitfieldbeershop.co.uk/aboutus.htm] which evolved out of a craft brewery which was a mid-â80s CAMRA award winner, but it caters only to the local British market to stay within the scope of the local law.  <p>

And while we may never see true global e-brewing, there are firms catering to the true beer geek, those fans desperate to select that one long-sought, truly rare monkish brew or local German craft ale. Try BelgianShop [http://shop.belgianshop.com] or the Cracked Kettle [http://www.crackedkettle.com], for example. The down side is the amount these services charge for shipping, as the weight of beer and the need to send it by courier combine to make a few beers cost about as much as a few cases.   Far more reasonable from a shipping point of view are beer of the month clubs, like the one under the name of Michael Jackson, Beer Hunter [http://rarebeerclub.beveragebistro.com/join_rbc.html]. The catch is that with these services, you receive what is selected for you. Neither type of service is any threat to your local beer shop, but each in their way adds something that can extend what is available to you and your beer loving friends.<p>

Homebrewing, on the other hand, is doing quite well on the Internet. There are numerous sites where homebrewers can swap recipes and even beer.    Homebrewers have recorded years of interactive discussion of the internet, the most venerable one is the utterly unfancy Home Brewers Digest, with its valuable archive of daily questions and comments among the amateur brewing community dating back to 1988 [http://www.hbd.org.]   In addition to this sharing among the fellowship of the craft, many of the shops that supply their ingredients are doing a brisk on line business.  Itâs worth noting that every homebrew shop that advertises in this paper has their web address in the ad.<p>
 					
Some craft breweries may be accused of remaining in the two-dimensional old school Internet, where the feedback is limited to emailed comments back to the staff or maybe a visitorâs guestbook.  Their sites may be bright and fun featuring information about the beer and even dancing beer kegs but they are not particularly participatory from the customerâs point of view.  There are good reasons for this. Brewers are busy brewing and, except for the larger brewers, the fan base that the internet offers may be seen as too dispersed for the most part, too far from the actual beer that the brewery needs to put in the hands of fans.  And the cost of paying staff to both trigger and moderate discussion might be too much for many smaller brewers. <p>  

But moving to a more responsive Internet presence is a great form of marketing and some breweries are already taking on the challenge of the responsive world of Web 2.0.   Scott Gallagher of Rogue Ales told me by email that Rogue believes their website has to be informative about our beer and beer in general, but also entertaining.<blockquote><i>

We''re currently revising our website to be more informative, adding video and tours, you''ll even be able to sign up for the Rogue Nation online and take the pledge of Rogue-legiance. We''re also going to have a blog and myspace page.</i></blockquote>
		
In the Great Lakes region there are plenty of amateur bloggers, but the Flossmore Station Brewpub in Illinois is an example of another use of blogs--a craft brewer taking on the web to get in touch with his fans [http://flossmoorstation.blogspot.com.]  Beauâs Brewing near Ottawa is blogging, too [http://beausbeer.blogspot.com.]

The Internet is changing and craft beer is no different from any other part of life.   Just as many people now use it to publish their thoughts on blogs or to get just the song they need through downloading, many beer fans expect to be able to express and share their own thoughts with each other and with the breweries they love.  So while we may be a long way off from those web-based Trappist beer dispensing units some of us dream of, great beer is a generator of great discussion whether it is on the Web or on a bar stool.', '2007-04-08 14:16:56', '2008-06-12 14:46:58.580455', 0, true, true, true, 'beeronthe', true);

Boo.', '<div style="text-align: justify;"><h4><b>Going from fresh to frozen</b></h4><p>
If you are a fan of Tim Hortons, be warned. Frozen doughnuts, fried in a factory near Toronto and trucked 2,000 kilometres, are about to replace fresh, locally made doughnuts at stores in Atlantic Canada.  Tim Hortons is being secretive about this major change. No news release has been issued, no celebratory advertising campaign launched.<p>But franchise operators are busy preparing for the coming change. Franchisee Stephen Breed addressed the issue in an Aug. 25 letter to staff at his outlets in Dartmouth and the airport.<p>I called Breed on Monday, but have not heard back. Also Monday, I called Andrea Hughes, Tim Hortons manager for Atlantic Canada, at the regional headquarters in Debert. She said she&#8217;d phone back, but never did. And the national vice-president of corporate communications for Tim Hortons, Patty Jameson in Oakville, Ont., didn&#8217;t called back, either.<p>Hmm, is there something they don&#8217;t want to talk about?<p>A year ago, Tim Hortons built a 230,000 square-foot plant in Brantford, Ont. It has the capacity to supply all Canadian and U.S. Tim Hortons outlets with doughnuts, cookies and croissants. From one central factory, all Tim Hortons snacks can be shipped to the hinterland.<p>This follows a U.S. trend toward mega-bakeries that freeze their product, put it on trucks and ship it everywhere else. In upstate New York, one Granny&#8217;s Kitchens factory makes more than 1.5 million doughnuts a day.<p>The frozen doughnuts, cookies and croissants are then resuscitated by staff in local outlets. This can be done by anyone at the press of a button, meaning that bakers &#8212;among the best-paid people in doughnut shops &#8212; can be laid off.<p>(This major change in Tim Hortons policy is accompanied, at least in Breed&#8217;s outlets, with a policy change affecting what staff eats. Until now they could eat doughnuts for free; from now on they have to pay 50 per cent.)<p>Frying doughnuts in one megaplant and shipping them thousands of kilometres on trucks is not a move made with customers in mind. And it prompts some serious questions that must be asked.<p>Will the Tim Hortons motto &#8212; Always Fresh &#8212; be changed? Those words appear outside almost every outlet, all 74 in metro and more than 2,000 across the country. But is it fair to say &#8220;fresh&#8221; when a doughnut was fried days, weeks or, maybe, months ago? Does &#8220;fresh&#8221; mean fresh, or resuscitated? Would continuing to say &#8220;fresh&#8221; be false advertising?<p>Last winter, when I first revealed that Tim Hortons was planning to cook their snack foods in Ontario and send them on freezer trucks to Atlantic Canada, national communications VP Jameson attempted to sidestep the issue. <p>&#8220;We have not made any plans,&#8221; she said, &#8220;that are open for public knowledge.&#8221;<p>That much is true. That Tim Hortons is now putting their plan into action &#8212; again without telling us &#8212; only underscores the point.<p>Atlantic Canada has a 25-year love affair with Tim Hortons. For many of us, Tims is our favourite local meeting place. For some of us, it&#8217;s our home away from home.<p>
But it&#8217;s time to give this hallowed relationship a second thought. If I want a doughnut, I don&#8217;t want one cooked near Toronto.<p>The fact the Tim Hortons corporation is being sneaky about this just makes things worse.</div>', '2003-09-17 17:30:11', '2008-06-12 14:46:57.510342', 0, true, true, true, 'davidswick17', true);

The Omnifacts Bristol Research poll, conducted exclusively for The Guardian, indicates Premier Pat Binns and his Progressive Conservative party will return to power, but the Tories are in the fight of their lives, particularly in Queens County.<p>There are 13 seats up for grabs in Queens County and the capital city of Charlottetown and the Liberals are now in a dead heat with the Tories &#8212; only two percentage points separate the two parties.<p>
According to the poll of 500 Islanders conducted last week, the Conservatives have the support of 34 per cent of decided voters. The Liberals have the support of 27 per cent while the Island New Democrats are at a non-existent two per cent.<p>
The undecided factor remains at a record high of 34 per cent.<p>When Islanders who have not completely decided are factored into the poll &#8212; those pollsters would describe as leaning &#8212; the gap between the Conservatives and the Liberals starts to grow.  The Conservatives then get the support of 53 per cent of Islanders, 10 per cent higher than the Liberals which are at 43 per cent.<p>The Liberals started the campaign 19 percentage points behind the Conservatives in a poll conducted in August by Corporate Research Associates.<p>Craig Wight, vice-president of research for Omnifacts Bristol Research, says if the Liberals are going to make a breakthrough, it is expected to happen in Charlottetown and rural Queens County.&#8220;That&#8217;s the highest Liberal showing in the three regions,&#8221; Wight said in an interview with The Guardian.&#8220;It&#8217;s very close there. A couple of percentage points can make a real difference.&#8221; <p>The county breakdowns show support for the Tories strongest in Kings County at 47 per cent and weakest in Prince County at 30 per cent. Support for the Tories in Queens County is at 33 per cent.The Liberals have the support of 31 per cent in Queens County.Liberal support is at 26 per cent in Kings County and 22 per cent in Prince County.

While the Conservative party may have squandered its big lead, there is a lot of good news for the party in the poll.Pollsters say the party is in a position to be returned to power for its historic third term, that its leader remains by far the most popular for premier, and that the majority of Islanders expect the Tories to win the next election.About 56 per cent say they are prepared to give Binns another mandate. That compares to 27 per cent who say they are ready for a change.<p>Wight said while the Liberals have been able to narrow the gap, there is still no indication they have enough support to seriously challenge the Conservatives&#8217; control on government. He said the Liberals should be able to pick up a handful of seats.&#8220;It shows a solid majority here for the Tories, I don&#8217;t think there is any doubt of that in these numbers. They are well ahead here.&#8221; <p>As for who Islanders want in the premier&#8217;s office, the margin is 2-1 in favour of Binns.  The premier has the support of 51 per cent of Islanders. His highest level of support can be found in Kings County at 59 per cent while his lowest level of support is in Prince County at 44 per cent.  Ghiz only has the support of 25 per cent of Islanders for premier. His support is virtually the same across all three counties.  Island New Democrat Leader Gary Robichaud has only one per cent support.<p>The poll of 500 Islanders was conducted Sept. 18-20 and is considered accurate within plus or minus 4.5 per cent.  Wight said the only poll which truly counts is the one taken on election day. He said all three parties will have to work hard to try and secure as much of the vote as possible in the five days that remain in the campaign.&#8220;The polling is interesting and people, of course, like to look and plan, but really the only numbers that matter will the ones Monday.&#8221;<p>Editor&#8217;s Note: The Guardian will have more exclusive data from the Omnifacts Bristol Research poll Wednesday including a look at what issues are on the minds of P.E.I. voters days before the Sept. 29 provincial general election.

Posted by: christopher at September 26, 2003 10:06 AM<p>

I was going to add one thing by way of illustration of the need. If dr is a bureaucrat or junior insider, there is always the risk that sharing any belief might offend those above. We know from the courts (Burge, Condon rulings) what each of the past governing parties feel about people going about acting on political belief. My point is not to offend in saying this. It is to point out that anonymity might be particularly required in the context of a PEI election for either the reds or blues. This may be a sad fact but still a fact. Letting it be known that that is understood and that anonymity is welcome should facilitate freer more intellegent expression.<p>

As a kid, my Scots immigrant parents dressed us up in identical Marks & Sparks shorts and sent us off into new elementary school, a living hell in Sydney Mines, Cape Breton, after a move from Mississauga.  MacDonalds of a various genetic strains took turns giving me and my brothers fat lips.   So I have a soft spot for the dislocated.  One of my daily reads is Michael 
Demmons, a Newf who has lived in Atlanta, George for five years.  His web site <a href="http://www.discountblogger.com/">Discount Blogger</a> presents the view of a Canadian in the USA, a gay man in a fairly intolerant times and a libertarian in a world of sheep.  The best thing about the place is the great debate by people with a firm understanding of their positions combined with a welcome for civilized disagreement - even allowing anyone respecting the rules to post on Sundays.  While posts are largely about US politics, he quickly admits his outsider perspective when giving a position.   He is moving up into the dreaded A-list zone but hopes are high that he will maintain his edge.<p>In the other direction is another great site for debate, for a North Country New Yorker living for years in little PEI.   One of the oldest of the old school techies I know, <a href="http://humblebub.islandmusings.net/">Humblebub</a> cares little for gurus, usability consultants and lawyers.   Especially lawyers.  His site is largely a homebrewed mix of local provincial politics, web techie news, and by times rude observations on life.  His recent recollections about members of the older generations of his family from the counties around Adirondack State Park are his best writing yet.<p>My third site of the dislocated

I turn then to the meaning of "for the purpose of criticism" in section 29.1. I note first, that "criticism" is coupled with "review". The principle of statutory interpretation noscitur a sociis would suggest that the two words are likely related. One relationship is that for the criticism or review to occur there need to be excerpts from and references to the works being criticized or reviewed. Also, when criticizing or reviewing any given work it may be necessary to use quotes from others for comparative purposes.<p>

Among the definitions of the word "criticism" found in the Oxford English Dictionary , 2nd ed. (1989) are:<blockquote>Criticism:...<p>

The art of estimating the qualities and character of literary or artistic work; the function or work of a critic. . . . spec. The critical science which deals with the text, character, composition, and origin of literary documents...</blockquote>

The jurisprudence has established that it is not merely the text or composition of a work that may be the object of criticism but also the ideas set out therein. Hubbard v Vosper, [1972] 1 All ER 1023 (C.A.) is most often cited as setting out the relevant tests.</blockquote>

Other specific exceptions exist in the case of educational institutions, libraries, archives and museums, computer programs, incidental inclusions, ephemeral recordings, and sound recordings. It is true that Canadian courts have tended to apply exceptions to copyright infringement narrowly. Still -- and this is the crucial point -- the exercise of any exception presumes the ability to access a work. DRMs that prevent or severely limit access to a digital work render impossible an ability to exercise and enjoy the benefits of any exceptions allowed by law.</blockquote>', '2004-02-13 18:32:55', '2008-06-12 14:46:57.653159', 0, true, true, true, 'faircommentfor', true);

Just ask the hundreds of people who showed up.<p>More than 100 children hunted for 1,500 brightly coloured eggs on Saturday. They were joined by the Easter bunny and about 150 parents, grandparents, aunts and uncles who were on hand to help children find the chocolate and confectionary-filled plastic egg containers. <p>&#8220;It&#8217;s my favourite part of Easter,&#8221; said Steve Cooke, 10, whose taken part in the hunt for the last four years. <p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a chance to meet all kinds of new people,&#8221; said his mother, Joanna Cooke. <p>Susan Reynolds started the tradition seven years ago with an egg hunt for children who lived on Herchmer Crescent. <p>&#8220;I cooked it up with my friend one day,&#8221; she said. &#8220;We thought it sounded good.&#8221; <p>The first hunt was so successful that Reynolds expanded it the following year. It has grown every year since, and this weekend, it covered the entire Calvin Park area. <p>Reynolds remembers when the hunt was limited to Herchmer Crescent. &#8220;The street had a high population of kids per house. It worked well. <p>&#8220;People from neighbouring streets who had children, but not enough on their street to run their own hunt, were invited to ours.&#8221; <p>This year, the event was organized by 11 volunteers. Reynolds and a friend go to the Bulk Barn, where they have a special Easter egg hunt discount, to buy the candy for the eggs. This year, they bought about 40 kilograms&#8217; worth. &#8220;The kids end up with a big pile of candy,&#8221; she said. <p>It takes about two hours for the volunteers to stuff the plastic eggs with the various goodies, which are then hidden throughout the street.  &#8220;I save my candy in a container,&#8221; Steve Cooke said, &#8220;and I eat it as I go.&#8221; <p>&#8220;Self-imposed rationing,&#8221; his mother said.   &#8220;He&#8217;s learned from when he&#8217;s overdone it on junk food before.&#8221; <p>Children are allowed to gather as many as 12 eggs each. Reynolds&#8217; group, which plans for extra kids to show up, lets older children gather up any eggs not collected at the end. <p>She has two children of her own &#8211; Michael, who is 11, and Taylor, 10. Reynolds said that the hunt not only gives children a chance to have fun, but gives parents of similarly aged children a chance to meet. <p>&#8220;There was a family that moved in whose children went to a school out of district. I invited the mother and family out for Saturday and she ended up meeting other parents who lived close by that had kids the same ages as hers.&#8221; <p>A chance to meet new people works as well for the adults as the different goodies work for the kids. This was also the first year that Reynolds needed to accommodate a child with a peanut allergy. However, Steve, who admits to being a lover of caramel-filled chocolates hidden inside turquoise-coloured eggs, said that the sweet surprise of the hunt is not the only reward for participating. <p>&#8220;I love meeting people and going out and searching,&#8221; he said.  Both Steve and Reynolds think that an Easter egg hunt is a great event. &#8220;I usually don&#8217;t get to see people until the summer, or now at Easter,&#8221; Steve said. <p>&#8220;Everyone&#8217;s been inside the whole winter,&#8221; Reynolds said. &#8220;It&#8217;s nice to come out and to socialize.  This area originally had a strong sense of community,&#8221; she said. &#8220;It&#8217;s nice to have something like that again.&#8221;', '2004-04-12 15:38:17', '2008-06-12 14:46:57.667174', 0, true, true, true, 'whigmonday12', true);

The result on Saturday was, I''m not exageratting, one of the worst in Greenock Morton Football Club''s history. Being rogered 4-1 at home while going for promotion, by one of the worst teams in Britain, shot shy relegated and shite, is not to be thanked.<p>

The scoreline is bad, the game itself was odd - I thought there was some semblance of effort and passion back in the second half, but nothing really went our way at all.<p>

No matter - the history books show that result, and every football journalist and football fan for that matter, whoever their team is, in Scotland has probably noticed how catastrophically we have capitulated in the last few months.<p>

It''s @!#$ jawdropping.<p>

At this stage in the season, I want players hurling themselves in front of the ball at the back, using every sinew and ounce of energy in the their bodies to stop the opposition from scoring. I want the forward players doing similar, using everything in the their power to get the ball in the net. I want the midfield working their arses off and not hiding, treating it, apparently, as if it were just another game. We have seen it from part time journeymen players like in Allan McGraw''s team who lost out on goal difference to get promoted to the Premier League. Just watched that footage on Friday night before the Stenny game, and it was amazing to see the spirit there, the HUNGER, from guys who drove forktrucks during the day, or lugged about boxes and bottles on their backs for a living. You know who I am talking about.<p>

Well I am sorry to the boys, they may be reading all this, and I am sorry if I am out of line questioning whether they were trying their hardest or not - it''s been a long hard season - but it''s been a long hard season for part timers and relegation fodder Stenhousemuir as well, and there is no way a Morton team should be throwing up results like that at this stage in the season.<p>

All we want is play with passion and pride. I''m sorry but we did not see that on Saturday. <p>

They were at the GMST Player of the Year do on Saturday night, and looked suitably sheepish, and to be fair to them they certainly still looked shellshocked and gutted. The only one I spoke to was Chris Millar who I congratulated on winning the award, and he''s the only one I really felt like speaking to in any case as I felt let down by the rest of them - Chris was all over the park on Saturday, he had that hunger I want to see. HE looked like a FULL TIME player. He looked like he wanted to go up.<p>

John and Marco in Word Up later that night - yeah, looked forlorn and annoyed. But stop that happening ON the pitch lads. I know you are not superhuman, but we shouldn''t be getting tore up by Stenny and Dumbarton and Berwick, man...<p>

I feel absolutely and totally gutted about this. Call me an idiot if you want, but this feels worse than relegation to me. And I think some of you will agree with me.<p>

In time I will forgive like the bloke who started this thread, but at the moment I am utterly heartbroken, and that''s why I don''t think I''ll post much for a bit. Because I know if I start, then I won''t stop! A bit like now.<p>

But don''t get annoyed when you see other people getting annoyed at the side. They''ve let the fans down badly, and the good guys in the team will appreciate that as much as any of us. They have a slim chance to rectify that on Saturday, either with a pride restoring good performance against the Champions, or with a miraculous promotion.<p>

They would barely deserve it to be honest, after Saturday, and I would feel incredibly sorry for Dumbarton and Accies'' after the GRIT and STEEL and PRIDE they have shown in the last quarter to drag themselves back into conceivably getting promoted on the last day of the season. If only we could be so proud of our own players.<p>

You have one last chance to get some semblance of pride back to this club on Saturday, lads. I don''t like following a laughing stock, but it''s my @!#$ calling in life.<p>

Try and make it a bit easier for us all on Saturday, get a win, and perhaps get out of jail if someone up there really likes you.<p>

One of the main faults we had in the 2nd half of the season was the fact we gave up on our passing game.<p>

In the 1st half of the season we built up attacks from the back, normally passing from Derek Collins to Marco Maisano. We were then getting movement from players, Chris on the right, Mel on the left & Stuart pushing up on the right as well, when given the space.<p>

The ball would then normally have gone to one of the above or to John in the middle. But we kept it simple pass & move, probing the opposition for any openings. Further up the field would bring Walker, Weatherson & Williams into the passing moves. Again keeping it simple, supporting the players around them & making space for themselves. The key to our early season form was possession, playing the ball to feet & exploiting the gaps left for us.<p>

In some of our early games we must have had around 60/65% of the ball & that''s what gave us control & allowed us to dominate teams.<p>

This changed round about the time Greacen got injured. Suddenly we didn''t have the option of one of the back 3 breaking forward & putting more pressure on the opposition. The players who came in at varying times were more comfortable hoofing the ball up the park, thus cutting out the slow methodical build-up which had served us so well.<p>

It also meant that our forwards who were more comfortable on the ground & showing a burst of acceleration, were now having to scrap out aerial duels which were meat & drink to opposition defenders.<p>

The death knell for the slow build-up was probably the Partick cup game. The 1st goal we lost was due to Partick closing down on that ball played from defence to midfield by Derek to Marco. They had watched us & knew it was coming & being a Premier team were fit enough to harry us out of our normal game.<p>

Whether this spooked us or not, who knows ? But after that the slow build-up quickly disappeared from view. Instead of understanding that this was a team 2 leagues above us, we threw out the baby with the bath water, & gave up on the style which was obviously highly successful in the 2nd Division.<p>

Since then our form has slumped further & further. We no longer keep possession for any great lengths of time, thus allowing more physical teams to overrun us. The service to our forwards has all but dried up as we no longer play to our strengths. As soon as our defenders clear the ball it''s coming right back at them. We''ve become experts at putting ourselves under pressure.<p>

As far as this Saturday goes away to Airdrie, Cowboy could go back to the side that beat them 6-1 up there, which I believe has never played together again in the league since. Whether he could restore that pass & move game at such a crucial time is highly dubious. The players'' confidence & form is now all but shot to hell & some of them look as if they''d rather be anywhere else but on the park. <p>

In saying that I''d rather see them try that style again now & play a bit of football, rather than some of the long ball crap they have been doing. <p>

We can but try. <p><p><p><b>3. From the Office of the Chairman</b><br>

FROM THE OFFICE OF THE CHAIRMAN <p>

"LAST CHANCE SALOON" '' <br>
Tomorrow we all head for Airdrie for the final match of the season which will decide the outcome of our season. Before we know the outcome let me take a minute to thank every supporter for the fabulous support that you have given to the team throughout the entire season, even latterly when we have not been doing at all well. I have said it many times before but another time will not go amiss; that it is the quality and numeracy of our support that has inspired me to input as much as I have to improving both the stadium and the team. I salute you all!! <p>

I spoke with our team this morning and thanked them for the fantastic high points that they have provided us with this season and although we have also had many low points (none more so than last Saturday and at Hamilton) I still have a sense of pride in the boys. <p>

I told them that with one game to go that there was really little difference to what we faced in our final game last year. We had to win it or we would not have been promoted. Similarly if we do not win tomorrow then there is no way that we can be promoted this season. The only difference this year is that the ultimate outcome is not in our own hands as we have to rely on Forfar taking something off Hamilton which certainly is not impossible. <p>

Let me say here and now that if we do not make it to the First Division this season then further improvements in personnel will be made during the close season to try and ensure that the promotion that we all crave will be achieved next season. <p>

The Club and I have had an enormous number of letters and ''e'' mails from many battle hardened supporters assuring us that, irrespective of the outcome tomorrow, they will be back with us next season to cheer the Ton yet again. Such messages have been both uplifting and re-assuring. <p>

My very best wishes go with you all; have a good summer break and come back amongst us to play your own vital role again next year.<p>

Bye for now,<p>

By Sharon Ho<br>
Local News - Monday, September 27, 2004 @ 07:00<p>

Brothers Dave and Roy Nor-wood know good beer when they taste it.  And they&#8217;re willing to travel more than 5,000 kilometres to get it.<p>

The pair, regulars at the King-ston Brewing Company, the city&#8217;s famed microbrewery and pub, live in Teddington, a suburb of London, England.  The brew-loving brothers visited Kingston for the eighth year in a row, relishing their ideal vacation &#8211; a week drinking beer in a Kingston pub.<p>

&#8220;We like Kingston,&#8221; said 59-year-old Roy, the talkative one.  He and his 64-year-old brother first came to the Limestone City in 1992.  &#8220;We&#8217;ve seen all the tourist areas in Kingston, so now when we come we naturally gravitate to the brew pub,&#8221; said Roy.  &#8220;We have a few beers.&#8221; <p>

On a midweek afternoon, Dave and Roy sat at the bar drinking their first pints of cranapple ciders for the day.  They watched the television in the corner in between chatting with the staff and other customers.  The brothers began their vacation in Toronto and, after a few days, came to Kingston.   Dave is a computer analyst programmer while Roy quit his job as a bartender about five weeks ago.   &#8220;It&#8217;s two weeks of relaxation to wind down from a year&#8217;s work,&#8221; explained Roy. &#8220;We&#8217;re then ready for another year of work. For us, this [coming to the brew pub] suits us fine.&#8221;<p>

Their daily routine this year began with a few pints of cider before moving onto a few pints of the pub&#8217;s Dragon&#8217;s Breath Real Ale.   Roy and Dave are slow drinkers. They arrive at 1:30 p.m. and are only on their second pint of cider at 4 p.m.  The two vary their schedule.  &#8220;We&#8217;ve been known to be knocking here at 11 a.m.,&#8221; said Roy.  It&#8217;s not unusual for Dave and Roy to hang out at the brew pub for as long as 10 hours. &#8220;We generally leave before we become a nuisance,&#8221; said Roy.  Though they spend time there, they don&#8217;t spend a lot of money. The two spent $80 last Monday, which included two meals.   Dave likes Thursdays at the pub &#8211; East Indian curry day. Roy prefers the chicken pot pie.<p>   

While in Kingston this time, the brothers made only one other venture: a motorcycle tour around Kingston with Wally High, Dan Aykroyd&#8217;s road manager.  The brothers met High at the brew pub a few years ago, and though the friendship has grown, the ride won&#8217;t likely be repeated. Dave &#8211; pointing to his protruding stomach &#8211; found it uncomfortable.  Day and night, the brothers aren&#8217;t far from a pub. Instead of booking a room at a hotel, they bed down in the apartment above Ben&#8217;s Pub where they know the owner, Paul Timmers.<p>

Any drinking they do at Ben&#8217;s is done in the evenings. Roy and Dave tend to drink Alexander Keith&#8217;s beer there, though they prefer English-style beers.  &#8220;We can drink the Canadian beers, but after a while they get gassy for us,&#8221; said Roy.   Brew pub manager Alison Healey, while chatting with Roy and Dave, said she&#8217;d only known them for a week, but had heard of them before.  &#8220;I just heard that there&#8217;s two weird blokes who fly all the way over from England out of their pub and into ours to drink beer.   &#8220;I find that rather bizarre,&#8221; she said, laughing. &#8220;Unique and bizarre.&#8221;   &#8220;Weird. Yea,&#8221; added Roy.   &#8220;I take it as a huge compliment,&#8221; said Healey.   &#8220;If you&#8217;re going to leave the country of beer to come all the way over to Canada and drink our Dragon&#8217;s Breath, well, hey that&#8217;s a good thing.&#8221;<p>

Roy and Dave also bring gifts for the brew pub. They brought many of the beer taps hanging there, taps for English beers such as Adnams, Spitfire and Smiles.  Healey had brew pub gifts to give the brothers but would only say, in front of Dave and Roy, that they are special edition paraphernalia.  Peter Snell, the brewer, showed Roy a preview of the hemp beer in the brewing room behind the bar.  &#8220;It smells gorgeous,&#8221; said Roy as he came out. The brewer isn&#8217;t surprised to see Roy and Dave each year.  &#8220;I didn&#8217;t bat an eye when I saw them,&#8221; said Snell. &#8220;They&#8217;re our longest-distance regulars.&#8221;<p>

By Ian Elliot<br>
Local News - Monday, May 30, 2005 @ 07:00<p>

Firefighters suspect a major fire that burned a huge swath of the Great Cataraqui Marsh was deliberately set.  Kingston firefighters were initially called to a large and fast-moving blaze just east of Weller Avenue right before 8:30 p.m. While they were battling that fire, which appeared to have started near the shore and burned out in a concentric ring, another blaze started about a kilometre north of the original fire and burned its way northeast towards Highway 401. "Field mice don&#8217;t usually carry matches," observed Kingston Assistant Deputy Fire Chief Les Meers dryly after the second blaze broke out.<p>Kingston Police Staff-Sgt. Greg Sands said last night the fire will be investigated, although no one was in custody last night.  "There were reports that two youths were seen running from the area shortly after [the fire] and that will be investigated," he said.  There were no reports of property damage as winds blew the fire away from the shore of the Cataraqui River.  Nearby homes are protected by the CN Rail track which acts as a firebreak.

"The winds were in our favour this evening," said Meers.  "They were blowing east and pushing the fire towards the river."  More than 20 Kingston firefighters were called out to fight the fire yesterday evening and it had been largely extinguished by press time. Several firefighters were to have been posted on the scene overnight to guard against flare-ups.  Much of the firefighting was done by crews with backpacks holding several gallons of water, which they refilled from a tanker some distance from the fire.  As the fire spread, they tapped into a hydrant on Shaw Street and ran the hose through a trench they&#8217;d excavated underneath the railway tracks.  "It&#8217;s something we don&#8217;t like to do, but we have to," explained Meers.<p>The fire was intense, and people watching it from their back porches along Montreal Street said, at its height, they could feel the heat from the flames on their faces from a distance of several hundred metres.  The fire also drew hundreds of curious spectators, who clogged area roads and bridge overpasses that offered a view of the fire.  A number of people also drove to a quarry on Highway 15 in the former Pittsburgh Township that offered a panoramic view of the marsh.  There was a street-party atmosphere at the scene as people brought babies in strollers and carried digital or video cameras to snap pictures as the massive blaze spread.  Cars also slowed or pulled over on the shoulder of Highway 401 to watch the fire burn and Kingston firefighters were ready to close that stretch of highway if the fire drew too close and interfered with visibility.  Train traffic was slowed but not stopped as crews fought the fire. Several slow-moving trains passed through the area during the fire, with passengers on the trains pressing against the windows to see the blaze, which shot flames and embers 10 metres high at its peak and whose plumes of smoke could be seen for miles.<p>Bystanders lined the tracks and had to be shooed off by police and firefighters as trains passed through the area.  The fire department has a boat but didn&#8217;t call it out last night.  The fire department has been called to the marsh a half-dozen times already this year as a lack of rain has left it tinder dry, but yesterday&#8217;s fire was by far the largest this year.  The marsh burns regularly in the spring and fall. While the spectacular fires rarely threaten houses, they do pose a threat to the phone lines that run along the east side of the tracks. They weren&#8217;t damaged in last night&#8217;s fire.  In 1995, a particularly large fire destroyed 250 hectares of marsh and burned for almost 24 hours.', '2005-05-30 16:56:51', '2008-06-12 14:46:57.957194', 0, true, true, true, 'kingstonwhig30', true);

WATERTOWN - It wasn&#8217;t over until the final out on Sunday afternoon at Duffy Field as the Watertown Wizards defeated the Saratoga Phillies 6-5 in a thrilling NYCBL Eastern Division game. The Wizards improved to 5-1 while the Phillies fell to 4-5. It was a Father&#8217;s Day game that saw the lead change hands three times with Watertown taking the lead for good in the bottom of the sixth inning on a two-out two-run RBI double by Vinny Pennell (Franklin Pierce) making it 5-4 Watertown. Pennell ended the day going 1-4 with two RBI and two runs scored. Pennell then scored the game-winning run on the next at-bat as he was stealing third when Saratoga catcher Kevin Pratt launched his throw into left field allowing Pennell to come home. The Phillies cut the lead to 6-5 in the next inning on a RBI single by Kendall Horner (Oklahoma State). Joe Malzone made his fifth appearance of the season in the 9th inning, striking out two and forcing a ground-out to end the game with runners on first and second. Malzone earned his fourth save of 2005 and he has been a part of all five Wizards victories. Mike Schellinger (Oneonta State) started for the Wizards allowing five runs on five hits with two walks and four strikeouts in garnering his second win in as many starts. The Wizards pounded out six hits against Phillies pitching led by Sean Conley (Pitt) who had his best game as a Wizard going 3-4 with a run scored. As a team, the Wiz were off and running, stealing five bases in the game. Saratoga racked up seven hits against Watertown pitching paced by TJ Baxter (New Orleans) who was 3-4 with three RBI. Greg Young (Tulane) took the loss for the Phillies throwing 1.1 innings of middle relief, allowing four runs on two hits with three walks. Starter Pat Riley (James Madison) lasted 4.1 innings giving up just two runs on three hits with two K&#8217;s. Relievers Walker Sudduth (Ole Miss) and Matt Kimbell (Rutgers Newark) threw 2.1 innings of scoreless relief. Like in their first meeting, Saratoga drew first blood in the fourth inning. With a runner on second, TJ Baxter smacked a two-out RBI single to put the Phillies up 1-0. Watertown answered in the bottom half of the inning with Anthony Mendillo (Florida Tech) socking a base hit to center field scoring Jeff Grantham from second to tie the game. Two batters later and Sean Conley on third, a pass ball got away from the catcher allowing Conley to score. Watertown tacked another run on in the fifth on a RBI single from Patrick Feeney (Marist). Saratoga took the lead back in the top of the sixth against Schellinger. An infield error by the Wizards and a walk loaded the bases for Adam Cronk. Cronk knocked a runner in from third with a sacrifice fly cutting the lead to 3-2 Watertown. TJ Baxter followed by driving in the runners left on with a two-run RBI single putting Saratoga up 4-3. The Wizards return to action Monday evening in a make-up game against the Mohawk Valley Cobras at Duffy Fairgrounds with first pitch at 7:00pm.

One of the largest freighters on the Great Lakes ran aground less than a kilometre from the Thousand Islands Bridge near Gananoque yesterday afternoon.<p>The Canada Steamship Lines vessel Niagara, a 222-metre-long bulk carrier, lost control of its steering while approaching the American Narrows stretch of the St. Lawrence Seaway, near Alexandria Bay, just after 1 p.m.<p>It ran aground off St. Helena Island, a small island just east of the southern span of the international bridge.<p>Although a hole was ripped in the hull of the freighter during the grounding, it wasn&#8217;t considered serious and the freighter was able to refloat itself while waiting for Coast Guard officials to inspect the damage and judge whether the vessel was fit to resume its journey.<p>"It was basically minor damage," said Annie Pare, speaking for CSL.<p>"No one was hurt and there were no spills that would cause an environmental problem."<p>She said the hole was in the forepeak area of the ship, an empty space in the front of the vessel that&#8217;s used for holding cargo or for trimming the ship.<p>The ship went aground in American waters so it was the U.S. Coast Guard that launched a fast boat to the scene, and then followed up with its inspectors, said Coast Guard spokesman Dave Mergenthaler.<p>He said the ship was carrying a load of coke, a coal byproduct used in making steel, and didn&#8217;t spill any cargo or fuel into the water after running aground.<p>"It had a soft grounding, and although it did have a hole in the forepeak that filled with some water, they turned the pumps on and cleared it," he said.<p>No one was injured in the grounding and the Seaway wasn&#8217;t closed to other vessels.<p>The ship sent out a call on its radio alerting authorities to its grounding at about 1:15 p.m., and immediately afterwards a number of citizens who heard the call went out in their boats to take a look and to offer assistance.<p>The cause of the grounding wasn&#8217;t clear last night but will be investigated by the Coast Guard.<p>"It suffered a steering casualty but the cause for the whole thing is under investigation," said Mergenthaler.<p>Investigators were on scene by 5 p.m. to evaluate the damage. The vessel could be cleared to go overnight if the damage was judged not severe enough to impair its ability to travel safely.<p>The Canadian Transportation Safety Board, which investigates accidents involving federally regulated transport in this country, said it wouldn&#8217;t be conducting an investigation because the incident happened in American waters.<p>Federal records show no previous accidents or groundings involving the Canadian-flagged ship.<p>The ship started life as the J.W. McGiffin in 1972. It was enlarged in 1998 when the Seaway increased the size of vessels it could accommodate and became the first "SeawayMax" vessel to travel the St. Lawrence. It can carry 34,938 tons of cargo.<p>The last major grounding of a ship in this area happened in 1999, when water levels were at historic lows and the 160-metre long Bahamian-registered Sunny Blossom hit bottom on the southeast tip of Wolfe Island with a cargo of caustic soda.<p>The ship had some of its cargo transferred to another ship to lighten it and was pulled out of the mud by tugs several days later. The ship ran aground near Cornwall just two months later, and in 2002 was crippled by an engine-room fire off the coast of Algeria.<p>In August 2003, before he became prime minister, Paul Martin formally transferred control of CSL to his three sons after MPs raised concerns over potential conflicts of interest.', '2005-06-29 14:14:44', '2008-06-12 14:46:57.966418', 0, true, true, true, 'kingstonwhig29', true);

Annex frat house bane of neighbours
17 in one house &#8212; `I''m not going to lie''<p>

CHRISTIAN COTRONEO
STAFF REPORTER<p>

It''s the season of the student.

And few brace for that riotous rite of autumn more than the Annex neighbourhoods surrounding the University of Toronto, where noise complaints flow fast and furious.

Jennine Profeta, who lives across the street from Delta Kappa Epsilon at the corner of Lowther Ave. and St. George St., sums up the neighbourhood sentiment:

"September is a little slice of hell."

The sprawling fraternity house has long been the front line in the timeless battle between the back-to-school brigade and red-eyed residents.

Looking out the window of its television room &#8212; a makeshift home theatre with rows of mismatched couches &#8212; it''s easy to see why.

An apartment building swallows the view, seeming almost on top of the red-brick house. There''s another building just like it on the other side. Not to mention a crop of older Annex houses, just an upward turn of the stereo volume dial away.

"Thankfully we have a church over there," says fraternity president Ben Lee, pointing at the only non-residential space on the block.

Delta Kappa Epsilon is in tight quarters.

For its part, Ben Lee says the fraternity is always looking for ways to party in a vacuum. They put insulation around doors and windows, urge partygoers not to loiter loudly on the balcony and even try to cultivate relations with the neighbours.

Last year, the fraternity threw a barbecue, blanketing the surrounding buildings with invitations.

"We pretty much told them, `Here''s what you can expect,''" Lee says. "It''s noisy," says Lee, a neighbouring renter who would only give her first name. "I live on the back side of the building so it''s not as bad for me. I know there have been people who have moved out of the building because of the noise.

"They''re living in a community," she adds. "They have to realize that &#8212; and have to bring their behaviour in line with everyone else in the community."

The community, however, has had a lot of time to adjust to its brash neighbour.

Delta Kappa Epsilon moved into the one-time nunnery in 1964.

Its pedigree, says Ben Lee, is nothing to sniff at. He can rhyme off dozens of movers and shakers who graduated from the fraternity''s international order.

`I know there have been people who have moved out of the building because

of the noise.''

Lee, a tenant living near frat house

"We''ve had guys start multi-billion-dollar corporations," Lee says. "We landed on the moon."

But, of course, during these formative years, it''s mostly police officers landing on their doorstep.

"What I would really like to do is just give (neighbours) our number," Lee says. "It would be really nice if they contacted us first instead of getting outside parties involved."

When school''s out, fraternity members head back home, as working boarders move in &#8212; and the house falls into its traditional summer hush.

But just before summer''s pilot light goes out, they return with all their enthusiasm for higher learning.

"September and October are our biggest couple of months," says social co-ordinator Russ Anderson.

"That''s when fraternities are looking for guys."

It''s easy to join Delta Kappa Epsilon, Anderson says. The guys just have to like you. And to get a sense of a potential member, the fraternity holds a host of functions.

There are mixers with sororities, pub nights that begin and often end at the house, and the handful of big-ticket parties hosted on the premises.

And the neighbourhood, for better or worse, keeps the beat.

"It does get loud, I''m not going to lie," Lee says.

"We do our best to control the whole noise issue. I try to put myself in their shoes.

"But it''s pretty hard when I have 17 guys living in the same house."

City Councillor Olivia Chow says complaints in her ward are nothing new.

About two years ago, she organized a meeting with all the fraternity houses, along with residents and police to work out their issues.

"It''s ongoing," she says.

"It might be time that we do another meeting. We find that we have to do that from to time.

In the aftermath of this weekend&#8217;s Homecoming havoc, Queen&#8217;s University officials say they will examine the future of the annual event.

Police and university officials vowed tough sanctions against those involved in an out-of-control street party that attracted between 5,000 and 7,000 people. During the mayhem late Saturday and early Sunday, a car was overturned and burned, an ambulance was blocked and police and other officials were pelted with bottles.

Asked whether Homecoming should be held next year, Janice Deakin, the university&#8217;s vice-president and dean of student affairs, said, &#8220;All options are on the table.&#8221;

In response to a question about whether it might be cancelled, she said she couldn&#8217;t rule this out. &#8220;We will be looking at all options,&#8221; she repeated.

George Hood, the university&#8217;s vice-principal of advancement, gave the same answer when asked whether the entire weekend&#8217;s events could be scrapped.

Kingston Police Chief Bill Closs praised his officers&#8217; restraint in the face of what he called &#8220;a drunken street brawl.&#8221;

Police and fire crews were pelted with bottles and other objects as the party raged out of control. One black officer was the target of racial epithets shouted from the crowd.

Closs said his officers were &#8220;subjected to the most vile and disgusting behavior that a police officer could possibly encounter.&#8221;

The 100 Kingston Police officers were outnumbered approximately 50-to-1 by the crowd of more than 5,000, many of whom were very intoxicated.

Police laid 200 liquor act violations and laid 19 criminal charges.
Thirty-five people ranging in age from 17 to 30 were arrested and spent the night in city police cells.

Closs estimated the bill for extra policing would be in the range of $60,000. That doesn&#8217;t cover police time that will be taken to prosecute all those charges.

Those arrested included a mix of Kingston residents and out-of-towners who came for the party.

But Closs wouldn&#8217;t blame the latter for the weekend problems.

&#8220;The people from out of town came to Kingston to take part in a drunken brawl,&#8221; he said.

&#8220;The catalyst for all of this is Queen&#8217;s Homecoming and students who host the drunken parties and I refuse to offload the responsibility on people who come in from out of town.&#8221;

&#8220;I can state that I am extremely disappointed and appalled by the behaviour of the people on Aberdeen Street,&#8221; Deakin said.

One of the main initiatives the university tried this year was a free concert featuring the Tragically Hip&#8217;s Rob Baker and others at the Miller Hall parking lot but it was lightly attended. City councillor Floyd Patterson, who represents the district and was touring the area until 1 a.m., said the pilot project was a flop.

&#8220;I would say, if they thought this pilot project would keep the students in one place and stop them from migrating out to the streets, it was an utter failure,&#8221; he said.

Although the worst was confined to Aberdeen, he said students blocked traffic, smashed bottles and otherwise disrupted other areas around campus where non-students live and said Queen&#8217;s needed to get a grip on the situation.

&#8220;This sort of behaviour is disgusting and angering and insulting to the permanent residents of this community and Queen&#8217;s needs to go a long way to addressing this,&#8221; he said.

The university will co-operate fully with police in prosecuting those identified as engaging in criminal behaviour this weekend, Deakin said, and will also conduct its own investigation.

It can also levy internal sanctions, such as fines, community service, suspension or expulsion against students and will be pursuing those options, Deakin said.

The student code of conduct, by which all undergraduate and post-graduate students are required to abide, specifically singles out massive block parties like this weekend&#8217;s as ground for punishment.

&#8220;[Students] should also bear in mind that compliance with this code implies non-participation in disturbances such as street parties which have been formally prohibited by the Senate, adherence to the laws governing the possession and/or consumption of alcoholic beverages and generally maintaining the reputation of the university,&#8221; the policy reads.

Sanctions against students are taken by a special committee of the Alma Mater Society and the Society of Graduate and Professional Students. Students can appeal those rulings to the university administration.

&#8220;It will be interesting to see how the AMS chooses to deal with these issues,&#8221; said Closs.

Deakin was on the scene of the massive street party on Aberdeen and praised city police for their restraint even as they were under assault by bottle-throwing revellers.

&#8220;I think the police were incredible,&#8221; she said.

&#8220;In the face of everything they had to deal with, they did an outstanding job.&#8221;

Closs said police, led by Insp. Brian Cookman, were under orders to use a &#8220;minimum&#8221; amount of force and that without co-operation of students, the only way they could possibly have restored order to the streets was through the use of a riot squad and weapons such as pepper spray and Tasers.

The difficulty of clearing the streets in such a way is that it leads to panic, and students would be in danger of being trampled in a rush if they were dispersed. Police would also be loath to disperse the crowd because there was nowhere to disperse the mob to except the surrounding streets where they could create more widespread mayhem.

Closs will be meeting with university officials in coming weeks to discuss the weekend incidents. He made it clear he&#8217;s not happy with the increasingly lawless Homecoming events and the burden that falls on his force to police them, the cost of which will be borne by city taxpayers.

He said if Homecoming continues, he would like to see a policy of, for example, mandatory expulsion of any student convicted of a criminal act or liquor licence infraction within a certain area of the student neighbourhood during Homecoming.

&#8220;We will be meeting with the university, but I have to say I am extremely disappointed in what happened on Aberdeen Street as a result of Queen&#8217;s Homecoming,&#8221; he said.

<p><p><p><h4>How a Homecoming celebration disintegrated into violence</h4>

By Frank Armstrong
Local News - Monday, September 26, 2005 @ 07:00<p>

A year of planning and a massive police presence failed to prevent an annual Homecoming street party Saturday from spiralling into a near-riot in which officers and firefighters were pelted with beer bottles and a parked car was rolled and torched.

Queen&#8217;s University, along with city and police officials, had hoped to prevent a repeat of last year, when 5,000 people attended an out-of-control street party on Aberdeen Street. In hopes of giving students something safer to do, the university this year staged a free, big-name concert on campus Saturday and police brought 100 officers to the Aberdeen Street area to try to keep any partying off the street.

But they were no match for the thousands of young people who teemed onto Aberdeen and intersecting William Street, as Whig-Standard photographer Mark Bergin and I soon found out.

We witnessed beer bottles exploding, fireworks shot from verandas, a car set on fire and broken glass everywhere &#8211; so thick, in fact, that it took several minutes to walk from one end of Aberdeen Street, a short avenue, to the other. Kingston Police Chief Bill Closs would later describe it to one of my colleagues as &#8220;a drunken street brawl.&#8221;

The evening had started off civilly enough as a series of small front-yard parties, before ballooning into mob violence. Here&#8217;s a chronology of a night that went out of control:



Saturday, 8 p.m.:

About 100 police arrive in full force in the Aberdeen Street area of the student ghetto. About one-quarter of them have already worked 24 to 30 hours over the last 48 hours and many look strained and tired.

In the morning, four illegal keg parties on Johnson and Collingwood streets and University Avenue were shut down and 56 people charged with alcohol-related violations.

(By early Sunday, we will later find out, more than 200 people face charges for Liquor Licence Act offences.)

Two rented white cube vans full of riot gear sit on Aberdeen Street and several marked and unmarked cruisers slowly circle the neighbourhood.

Dozens of officers stroll the streets. Some chat amicably with partygoers on their lawns while other, more stern-faced officers concentrate on keeping those consuming alcohol off public property, keeping pedestrians off the streets and ensuring people aren&#8217;t drinking in public.

Carrying a travel mug, I&#8217;m stopped twice by police who sniff the contents of the container.

At the corner of Aberdeen and Johnson, University of Waterloo engineering students Greg Packard and Cory Thorpe drink beer on the front lawn of the home of their friend, Mike Rakowski.

All day, the police have made it clear they aren&#8217;t putting up with any law-breaking and have said anyone who steps off private property will be issued a fine for drinking in public.

Packard and Thorpe are hoping for a wild night, but with the strong police presence, they wonder if the party will be curtailed.

&#8220;Last year there were 5,000 students on the street, but there are so many cops tonight,&#8221; says Thorpe, frowning. &#8220;It&#8217;s not going to happen.&#8221;

Rakowski, a Homecoming veteran, is more confident.

&#8220;It&#8217;s going to be a gong show,&#8221; he says. &#8220;If the cops start pushing, the people are going to start pushing back.&#8221;



8:45 p.m.:

One of the first of thousands of beer bottles is lobbed onto upper Aberdeen Street and explodes on the pavement. A half-dozen uniformed officers stride towards the vicinity. Others are trying to sternly order people to stay on the sidewalks, but the front-lawn parties are spilling over the curb. It&#8217;s hard to stay off the road.

The stench of marijuana thickens in the air. More bottles smash on the ground, prompting cheers.



9 p.m.:

Staff Sgt. Chris Scott, the number two officer on the street tonight, sits in his cruiser watching the crowd at the corner of William and Aberdeen. So far, things are looking good.

Police have been patrolling the student ghetto since 10 a.m. and there are now double the number of officers who were here last year. And people are listening to them and behaving fairly well for the most part, he says.

The concert in the Miller Hall parking lot, off Union Street, has been sold out, so Scott is hopeful a lot of people will go there instead of partying here.

&#8220;This is better than last year, I would say. I&#8217;m seeing a lot less open liquor,&#8221; Scott says.


&#8220;It&#8217;s early, but we&#8217;re encouraged by [all] that. We&#8217;re hoping if we use a consistent, fair approach the kids will accept it.&#8221;



9:30 p.m.:

At the concert, a sedate crowd of a few hundred people stands in front of a stage where Stripper&#8217;s Union, the new band of Tragically Hip guitarist Rob Baker, is playing. A few dozen students queue patiently at the gates to get in.



10 p.m.:

Back on Aberdeen, about 1,000 people walk the sidewalks and drink on lawns. Now, police are having a harder time keeping people off the roadway.

The police cube vans have left.

Chants of &#8220;Ole, ole&#8221; rise up all over the street.

On a lawn on upper Aberdeen, Carleton University students Natalie Langdon and Kaitlin Dubblestyne stand on a lawn talking to friends. The two travelled to Kingston for their first-ever Queen&#8217;s Homecoming and are having fun, but Langdon is a little nervous about the growing crowds.

&#8220;It&#8217;s pretty crazy,&#8221; she says, flinching as more bottles are smashed in the street beside her.

She sympathizes with police and says they&#8217;ve been good to the students so far. &#8220;It&#8217;s hard for them to keep a handle on the students,&#8221; she says.



10:15 p.m.:

The crowds are spilling onto the street and two mounted police make a final effort to push people back onto the sidewalks. One young man dances a jig beside one of the horses and is immediately bent over a police car and ushered away. The crowd presses around, chanting, &#8220;Ole, ole.&#8221;



10:30 p.m.:

The crowd rushes the streets with shouts of &#8220;F**k the police.&#8221;

More than 3,000 are now on Aberdeen and William streets and the police retreat.

At the concert, meanwhile, no more than 1,000 are standing quietly swaying to Metric. Dozens of students line up at the gates, but several are leaving.

&#8220;Everyone&#8217;s f**king dead,&#8221; one young man says to his friends as they turn for the exit.

A group of girls also leaves just minutes after entering. &#8220;Let&#8217;s go to Aberdeen,&#8221; says one of them.



10:45 p.m.:

On Aberdeen Street, a group of young men overturns a parked car and a dozen people jump on top of it, zealously stomping it, crushing it, breaking glass, swaying drunkenly and waving beer bottles in the air. The crowd around them again chants, &#8220;F**k the police.&#8221;

The car will be rolled several times before the end of the night.

As Whig photographer Mark Bergin wades into the throng around the overturned car, a police officer shouts after him, &#8220;If you go back into that crowd you&#8217;re on your own. Take care of yourself. We can&#8217;t come in to get you out.&#8221;

Firecrackers fly above the overturned car and the scent of gasoline is pervasive. But the crowd continues to push toward the crushed car and those who play King of the Mountain on top of it.

Queen&#8217;s students Brendan Moore and Phil Mahncke watch the spectacle from a yard nearby. Moore is sure this party is going to get even crazier.

&#8220;I think potentially there are going to be too many people for them to control,&#8221; he says.

&#8220;When the concert ends there will be too many people,&#8221; adds Mahncke.



11 p.m.:

Sometime before 11 p.m., groups of eight to 10 police officers form human barricades at each end of Aberdeen and William streets. They let people out, but no one is allowed in. A few officers in riot gear are standing nearby at attention.

There are now between 5,000 and 7,000 people here. House parties on Earl Street have also spilled onto the road. Hundreds of people line the police barricade on Earl in hopes of getting inside. Up on the west end of William Street, an ambulance backs off University Avenue.

A teenage boy is talking to a police officer behind the vehicle. His friend has consumed too much alcohol and has alcohol poisoning. She&#8217;s lying half-conscious and unable to move in the middle of the melee at the William and Aberdeen intersection and needs help.

Two paramedics pull a stretcher from the ambulance and stare into the crowd.

Staff Sgt. Scott is shouting into his radio. He needs backup &#8211; now.

He&#8217;s furious.

&#8220;I don&#8217;t know how long the city is going to put up with this,&#8221; he says. &#8220;We spent days on dialogue, we attempted to work with them. All we asked is for them to enjoy the parties, to keep the streets clear and this is what happens.&#8221;

A few minutes later, the two mounted police appear and head toward the thick of the crowd. It clears, begrudgingly, and the paramedics and Scott follow.

Fifteen minutes after the ambulance arrived, the young woman is found. Her body is like a rag doll as it&#8217;s strapped to the stretcher.

Another young woman is treated for cuts to her feet.

The procession cuts quickly back through the crowd, which snaps closed in their wake.

As Scott follows the young, sick girl back to the ambulance, a group of young men snarls at him and rains curses at his back.

Once on University Avenue, he shakes his head.

&#8220;That girl was passed out in the middle of that mass of people. You saw how long it took for us to get to her,&#8221; he says. &#8220;What if someone was ... gagging on their own vomit or had fallen from one of those balconies?&#8221;

He then nods at the police barricade at University Avenue.

&#8220;Now we sit back and we don&#8217;t let anyone else in the area and let the situation defuse and let them leave,&#8221; he says.



11:30 p.m.:

Bridgett Chapman is walking gingerly along William Street away from the crush of the crowd and toward the line at William Street&#8217;s east end.

The New Zealand native, who&#8217;s here for the Homecoming party with her University of Western Ontario boyfriend Tom Douglas, is wearing thin-soled shoes and has a sliver of glass in her foot. She&#8217;s never seen a bash like this one.

She&#8217;s having fun and thinks this is a great party, but she&#8217;s glad this isn&#8217;t her hometown. &#8220;It&#8217;s insane,&#8221; she says. &#8220;I would hate to live here.&#8221;

Douglas wonders if the police presence has spurred the crowd to act out, but both he and Chapman are relieved the police are here. &#8220;It would be crazy if the police weren&#8217;t here &#8211; maybe too crazy,&#8221; Chapman says.



Midnight:

Two fire engines enter the bottom of Aberdeen Street to deal with the overturned car, which is leaking gasoline, but are forced back by a barrage of flying beer bottles.

The stench of gasoline is now thick in the air. At the police barricade at Earl and Aberdeen, a young man bursts through and is quickly tackled and thrown against a wall by two police officers.

Adrian Fung, a sober-looking Queen&#8217;s engineering student, watches. &#8220;They grabbed his throat,&#8221; Fung says as the man is arrested.

He was here last year for this party. He thinks the stronger police presence this year has played some part in inciting the violence.

&#8220;They&#8217;re being way too tough. If the police were looser, the students would be looser, but because they are tensing up, the students are tensing up.&#8221;

Fung agrees that the police should be present for safety reasons, but doesn&#8217;t believe they&#8217;ll ever be able to stop the Aberdeen street party.

&#8220;It&#8217;s a tradition,&#8221; he says. &#8220;Queen&#8217;s spirit is really high and they don&#8217;t let traditions go very easily here.&#8221;



12:30 a.m.:

George Hood, Queen&#8217;s vice-principal of advancement, stands with two of his staff, Hilary Sirman and Richard Seres, at the east William Street police barricade.

The trio &#8211; all Queen&#8217;s alumni themselves &#8211; wear the yellow hats of the some 55 campus security staff and volunteers.

Hood, who&#8217;s in charge of planning Homecoming, has worked with the police, the city, the university&#8217;s student government and others for the last year to prevent this night from unfolding as it has. &#8220;This wasn&#8217;t exactly what we had in mind,&#8221; Hood says, frowning.

He and Seres say they&#8217;re angry that students are calling the Aberdeen Street party a tradition since it&#8217;s only been happening for four years.

&#8220;It&#8217;s not a part of Homecoming and people who call it a tradition are trying to create something to hide behind,&#8221; says Seres.

He points out that Homecoming is about welcoming back the university&#8217;s alumni and says it&#8217;s unlikely that many alumni are here tonight.

He suggests most of the people here aren&#8217;t even Queen&#8217;s students, but students from other universities. In fact, about one-third of the partygoers I interview at the street party aren&#8217;t Queen&#8217;s students.

Hood interjects. He says that doesn&#8217;t let Queen&#8217;s students off the hook.

&#8220;I don&#8217;t buy the excuse that these aren&#8217;t all Queen''s students,&#8221; Hood says. &#8220;If they aren&#8217;t Queen&#8217;s students, then they&#8217;re staying with Queen&#8217;s students.&#8221;

As Hood talks, a beer bottle smashes behind Seres, making the group jump.

&#8220;This is so frustrating. We pulled out all the stops and did everything we possibly could,&#8221; he said. &#8220;No one can be proud of this.&#8221;

The concert was supposed to be the big buffer, but it didn&#8217;t work.

All three bands &#8211; Stripper&#8217;s Union, Metric and Billy Talent &#8211; are big-name acts. The students got to see a show that normally would cost $100 for free, Seres says. About 4,000 tickets were distributed, but no more than 2,000 appeared to attended the concert.



1:30 a.m.:

The drunken crew wobbling on top of the overturned car is still being cheered on by the crowd. A dozen youths stomp on it, kick it and try to rip off pieces. One muscle-bound youth parades its muffler system up and down Aberdeen like a flag. Others carry pieces of its plastic bumper and smash them against a curb.

Two youths who are smashing the car start a new chant: &#8220;Set it on fire! Set it on fire!&#8221;

At the corner of Aberdeen and William, a mail box is slammed to the ground by a drunken, stumbling young man. Across the road, another youth man clutches a stop sign under his arm.

A naked man wheels around William Street on roller blades to whistles and cheers.

Nearby, Queen&#8217;s students Josh Guthrie and Aryan Kamyab blame the violence in the crowd on the police presence. &#8220;What you&#8217;re seeing is a reaction to the police,&#8221; says Guthrie.

Kamyab predicts the party will be even bigger next year as news of it spreads. &#8220;I&#8217;ve been here three years and year by year it&#8217;s going to get worse,&#8221; he says. &#8220;The police have obviously realized there&#8217;s nothing they can do.&#8221;



1:50 a.m.:

The party is thinning out.

A number of police officers venture up Aberdeen from Earl Street and start dragging and pushing people down the road, but they&#8217;re soon stopped by the crowd, hurling beer bottles at them.



2 a.m.:

Police again start clearing out the crowd; this time from the Johnson Street end. Most people are co-operating, but the party is still out of control around the rolled car.



2:30 a.m.:

The rallying cry to burn the car has picked up again.

&#8220;Burn it! Burn it!&#8221;

Flames can be seen through what appears to be the hole for the gas tank. A steady stream of beer bottles smashes against the burning vehicle, thrown by some unseen arm.

The police move in cautiously and begin clearing a wide circle around the car.

This time the crowd listens and moves &#8211; reluctantly.



2:40 a.m.:

A group of young people grabs Whig photographer Mark Bergin taking pictures of some very drunk students being arrested at the corner of Earl and Aberdeen.

&#8220;Hey, you&#8217;re going to make us look bad,&#8221; one young man shouts.

Two of the youths grab the photographer as a beer bottle slams into his shoulder. Beer is also poured over him.

&#8220;You have to get out of here. You are now in personal danger,&#8221; a police officer shouts at Bergin, who doesn&#8217;t need to be told that twice.



2:45 a.m.:

The car is engulfed in flame when the fire department arrives and extinguishes the blaze. The crowd applauds and cheers and promptly dissipates.

Several police officers now enter the party and ask people to leave.

This time, they meet little resistance.



3 a.m.:

Kingston Police Insp. Brian Cookman, who&#8217;s in charge of the city&#8217;s patrol officers, stands at the Earl Street barricade. A few firefighters continue to hose down the car and a stream of water trickles down the road.

The show is over, but Cookman, who has been awake for 72 hours, still has hours to go before he sleeps. He&#8217;s exhausted. But, more than that, he&#8217;s angry.

One of his officers was sucker-punched in the head and others were endangered by drunks throwing bottles.

&#8220;A beer bottle thrown from a second-story window is going to inflict serious injury or death,&#8221; he says.

&#8220;And I can&#8217;t believe the danger they [students] put each other in.&#8221;

Looking at the officers around him, Cookman says he&#8217;s extremely proud of the restraint they showed tonight.

&#8220;They endured all the taunts, all the verbal abuse, all the projectiles being hurled at them &#8211; and for what?&#8221; he said. &#8220;For trying to keep the peace.&#8221;

- With files from Mark Bergin<p><p><p><h4>Students repulsed by partying peers</h4>

By Ian Elliot
Local News - Monday, September 26, 2005 @ 07:00<p>

Students cleaning up Aberdeen Street yesterday afternoon said they were saddened and repulsed by the massive block party that turned into a near-riot early yesterday morning.

Some 25 student volunteers descended on the two-block stretch of road that was the site of an out-of-control street party the night before to fill trash cans and plastic bags with broken bottles and other garbage.

&#8220;It&#8217;s our mess,&#8221; explained Eric Chisolm, who held a shovel while another student scraped glass off the road with a broom to fill it.

&#8220;Everyone I&#8217;ve spoken to feels frustrated that some people would do these sorts of things.&#8221;

&#8220;We feel bad about what happened and we wanted to help clean it up,&#8221; said Nikki Punga, who was carefully gathering glass a short distance away.

&#8220;This is stupid,&#8221; said Emma Seaborn of the events of the night before and the cleanup.

The stretch of road was literally covered with shattered beer bottles, in some cases to the depth of several centimetres.
A city sweeper had cleared a path down the centre of the street early in the morning, but glass and bottle caps carpeted the street on either side and crunched under the tires of passing cars.

The cleanup effort wasn&#8217;t a formal one but was hastily organized by students phoning, e-mailing and instant-messaging each other to gather on Aberdeen Street wearing heavy gloves and thick-soled shoes.

Many bore the fading purple hue to their skins that marked them as engineering students.

&#8220;It&#8217;s our problem,&#8221; explained Matt Reid, one of the students who helped pull together the cleanup.

&#8220;It was bad last year and the city cleaned it up, but they didn&#8217;t have any workers here this morning and we didn&#8217;t want them to have to do it.&#8221;

They said events the previous night had spiralled out of control quickly as the crowd rose to as many as 7,000 on the short stretch of street after midnight.

&#8220;The atmosphere last night was different,&#8221; said Anne Keery. &#8220;It had an edge to it, it was scary.&#8221;

She and others denounced the crowd&#8217;s behaviour while calling for sanctions against those who were involved.

&#8220;There&#8217;s gotta be something done,&#8221; said Dan Piccininni, who joined the cleanup effort yesterday. &#8220;I&#8217;m really disappointed in what happened here.&#8221;

He was well away from the party on Saturday night but had seen drunken revellers on other parts of campus behaving badly.

&#8220;I saw people walking around spitting on cars, and that shouldn&#8217;t happen,&#8221; he said.

The students say most of the people on Aberdeen Street Saturday night and Sunday morning were Queen&#8217;s students, although as many as one-third were either city residents with no connection to the university or friends of students who came from other centres for the party.

They don&#8217;t offer that as an excuse but say the vandalism was done by a handful of people in the thousands who were there.

&#8220;This isn&#8217;t representative of the Queen&#8217;s community,&#8221; said Chisolm.

&#8220;There were maybe 20 people involved turning over a car but 5,000 people were watching them and saying &#8216;That&#8217;s stupid, that&#8217;s pointless vandalism and destruction of property.&#8217; &#8221;

The students didn&#8217;t have any solution to disturbances, except to cordon off Aberdeen Street.

One of the people helping with the cleanup yesterday was Donni Gauthier, a 1981 Queen&#8217;s grad. The roofer and painter picks up beer bottles in the heart of the student ghetto each Homecoming. He had collected more than $600 in empties by early yesterday afternoon.

He reflected on how things had changed.

&#8220;It&#8217;s crazy, it didn&#8217;t used to be like this,&#8221; he said, surveying the littered street. &#8220;Guys would drink and have fun, sure, but they wouldn&#8217;t destroy stuff. Kids are growing up differently now, attitudes are different now, and it&#8217;s sad.

&#8220;These kids, they figure they can do what they want and their mothers and fathers will pay for it.&#8221;

  Frank, the "permalink paradigm" was alive and well when I wrote my first CMS for Flutterby, which deployed sometime in February of 1998 (two months too late for this list, but 7 years ago nonetheless).<p>

The other early ones I had questions about: <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.whump.com/moreLikeThis/link/00001">More Like This</a> didn''t start until October of 1998, and <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.chaparraltree.com/honeyguide/19980605.shtml">Honeyguide didn''t happen until June of ''98</a>.

Yes, there were journalers on the web since early (Bryon Sutherland, anyone?), but that mix of links and short commentary in the reverse chronological format that, sometime in 1999, came to be called "blog" was pretty sparse in 1997.

  I registered sbw.org in August ''97 and shortly thereafter posted a reverse-chronological list of articles.  I didn''t (and still don''t) update it often, but it was my creative outlet, much like today''s blogs.  Some of those articles were back-loaded from emails I sent to groups of friends as far back as ''96.<p>

  The online running commentary about my life and what was new to the net started in November 1993. In 1995 I added a column I''d been writing for the customers of Sirius, a San Francisco ISP. In 1995 I also wrote a book published by Macmillan about CU-SeeMe, an Internet-based videoconferencing system. In 1995 my commentary about an anonymous digital money system, DigiCash, was added to the ''blog, as we were using it to "sell" the CU-SeeMe reflector list (for a digital penny).<p>

All of this was done with UserLand Frontier; version 1.0 of which was released in January 1992, and I''d had some beta versions. NCSA Mosaic, by Marc Andreessen et alia, arrived in early 1993.

Rebecca Blood writes "Jesse''s ''page of only weblogs'' lists the 23 known to be in existence at the beginning of 1999." Perhaps for some bizarre definition of ''blog. If you mean to say that SIX YEARS after Wired magazine''s issue 1.01 came out (Mar/Apr 1993) there were only 23 people posting "periodic posts on a common webpage... often but not necessarily in reverse chronological order" [Wiki], I got a big bridge to sell you.<p>

Dave Winer - the creator of Frontier - started his ''blog at the end of April 1997, wherein he speaks of Microsoft Internet Explorer 3.0. Not 1.0.

  Doing a bit more digging around on my site, I find that there was enough blogging to make an audience for people who wanted to know how tools like Dave Winer''s UserLand Frontier worked. Here''s a screen-shot from one of my how-tos, written on Christmas 1996.<p>

  Mickey, I think you''re missing a lot of historical perspective. I started an ISP in 1994 (and was part of a company  providing dial-up access to Usenet feeds and UUCP gated mail with internet addresses back in ''93, and actually wrote an HTML browser then). I''ve had active web pages since 1994.<p>

But the development of the web over those first years was a lot slower than most people remember. While there were magazine pages up there (I registered and abandoned several domains as attempts to get web based magazine pages started), discovering Dave''s Scripting News over that period where Steve Jobs was going back to Apple was a real eye-opener (I worked for Pixar, so that was the hook). Rather than publishing on a schedule Scripting News was continuously published, relied on outside links so that one person could keep the critical mass for a site like that going, and used tools to make that easy.<p>

Yes, there were journals back in 1994 (I mentioned Bryon Sutherland), and yes, there were reverse chronological links pages early on, but whatever that phenomenon was that became "blogs" (and was "microportals" and all sorts of other things before Jorn Barger''s "weblog" became the common usage), it really didn''t happen until mid to late 1999.<p>

A year and a half ago, in response to a claim Dave made about the history of weblogs, I <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.flutterby.com/archives/comments/6163.html">asked for weblogs not done in Frontier as of May 1999</a>. It''s been a long time since my web site could be called "A-list", but I''ve got some interesting email addresses, so I sent out a call for contributions. That list ain''t long.<p>

Yeah, maybe it was just a group that formed around Dave''s site and and the world was full of weblogs already, but it was at the dinners of that crowd where I met Ev and Meg and Jack from Pyra, and the LiveJournal folks, and that group was also where I saw that web publications weren''t either magazines, continuously updated and re-edited documents (like <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.flutterby.com/danlyke/whitewater/">my whitewater pages</a>), or angsty diaries with few links to elsewhere and no real sense of being a part of something larger.

  I''ve said before, and I''ll say again: The main difference between "diaries" or "journals" and "blogs" is primarily one of gender.  It''s like the way Coca-Cola felt compelled to create Diet Coke, because Tab wasn''t selling to men.<p>

See, I don''t see Frontier or Blogger or LiveJournal as creating a new category sui generis.  Rather, they were tools to automate what people were already doing by hand.<p>

I''m thinking here particularly of Derek''s former partners in crime like Magdalena Donea, Lance Arthur, and Alexis Massie (whom I collectively thought of as "The Chicago School", but that''s because I found Maggy first), but also such communities as Karawynn Long''s People Chase ring.<p>

The Youngstown Case.&#8212;The only recent case in which the &#8220;inherent&#8221; powers of the President or the issue of what executive powers are vested by the first section of Article II has been exten[p.421]sively considered36 is Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer,37 and the multiple opinions there produced make difficult an evaluation of the matter. During the Korean War, President Truman seized the steel industry then in the throes of a strike. No statute authorized the seizure, and the Solicitor General defended the action as an exercise of the President&#8217;s executive powers which were conveyed by the first section of Article II, by the obligation to enforce the laws, and by the vesting of the function of commander&#8211;in&#8211;chief. Six&#8211;to&#8211;three the Court rejected this argument and held the seizure void. But the doctrinal problem is complicated by the fact that Congress had expressly rejected seizure proposals in considering labor legislation and had authorized procedures not followed by the President which did not include seizure. Thus, four of the majority Justices38 appear to have been decisively influenced by the fact that Congress had denied the power claimed and this in an area in which the Constitution vested the power to decide at least concurrently if not exclusively in Congress. Three and perhaps four Justices39 appear to have rejected the Government&#8217;s argument on the merits while three40 accepted it in large measure. Despite the inconclusiveness of the opinions, it seems clear that the result was[p.422]a substantial retreat from the proclamation of vast presidential powers made in Myers and Curtiss&#8211;Wright.41<p>


Note:<blockquote>

36 The issue is implicit in several of the opinions of the Justices in New York Times Co. v. United States, 403 U.S. 713 (1971). See id., 727, 728&#8211;730 (Justice Stewart concurring), 752, 756&#8211;759 (Justice Harlan dissenting). Assertions of inherent power to sustain presidential action were made in Dames & Moore v. Regan, 453 U.S. 654 (1981), but the Court studiously avoided these arguments in favor of a somewhat facile statutory analysis. Separation&#8211;of&#8211;powers analysis informed the Court&#8217;s decisions in United States v. Nixon, 418 U.S. 683 (1974), Nixon v. Administrator of General Services, 433 U.S. 425 (1977), Nixon v. Fitzgerald, 457 U.S. 731 (1982), and Harlow v. Fitzgerald, 457 U.S. 800 (1982). While perhaps somewhat latitudinarian in some respect of the President&#8217;s powers, the analysis looks away from inherent powers. But see Haig v. Agee, 453 U.S. 280 (1981), in which the statutory and congressional ratification analyses is informed with a view of a range of presidential foreign affairs discretion combined with judicial deference according the President de facto much of the theoretically&#8211; based authority spelled out in Curtiss&#8211;Wright.

Kahn, 618 F.2d 784 (D.C.Cir.)

The Whig-Standard<br> 
Local News - Wednesday, March 01, 2006 @ 07:00<p> 

Civic officials are rethinking a $2.3-million child care plan jeopardized by a political pledge in Ottawa.  The newly elected Conservative government of Stephen Harper has vowed to kill a federal initiative of its Liberal predecessors that could have brought 160 new day care spaces to the area.  Under the scheme, Kingston and Frontenac County were to get millions annually in federal money to create new child care spaces, improve services in schools and provide more early intervention programs for children in need. <p> 

The city has the first-year funding, $2.32 million, in the bank, but has not yet spent any of the cash.  "We&#8217;ve got the money and we&#8217;re not giving it back," Lance Thurston, King-ston&#8217;s commissioner of community development services, said in an interview yesterday.  Thurston said the outgoing Liberal administration knew that a policy shift might come after the election, so they passed on the cash some time ago.  "They wanted to get this money to us before it got frozen, which was great," he said.<p>A committee of city staff, county staff, officials from the school boards and representatives from community agencies have been working together for more than six months to draft a comprehensive plan.  The group produced a 67-page report that documents existing child care programs, facilities and related services, including early intervention and special needs programs.  The $2.32 million in first-year funding, for 2005-06, is a lump sum, unconditional grant. The only requirement calls for it to be spent on child care initiatives.  Thurston&#8217;s department was supposed to bring a detailed plan to city politicians for approval this month.<p>It outlines the creation of more than 160 new child care spaces in six regions that have been defined after months of study, including underserviced areas of north Frontenac.  The money was to provide new spaces in schools, community facilities and in licensed home day-cares and it would pay some new staff, particularly for children with special needs. Roughly 30 per cent of the new spaces would be subsidized.  Thurston said within a day or so of the detailed plan landing on his desk, word came that the Conservatives pledged to kill the funding scheme, replacing it with lump sum payments to families of $1,200 a child.  <p>Thurston put the presentation of the city&#8217;s plan on hold.  "Any money that had been sent to us we could keep, but there would be no new monies," he said.  "If we proceed with the plan that has been prepared by the steering committee, go to council and get it approved and start spending all this money ... are we setting up an expectation that that&#8217;s going to be the level of service?" he said.  Once the federal money is exhausted, the city would have to hike taxes two to three per cent to make up the loss or ask the province to step in.  "What do we now do, knowing that the money has been shut off?&#8221; Thurston said. &#8220;It really fundamentally changes how you go about planning for the future."  He said the committee is meeting to reconsider the plan.  The Kingston-Frontenac area was to receive $2.32 million for the second year of the program and $4.15 million for the third year.  This week, the federal Liberals said they will fight the Conservatives over the plan to cancel the child care initiative, although party officials did not say they&#8217;ll vote against the minority Conservative government.<p>

Washington &#8220;yeast dork&#8221; claims tenth Beerdrinker crown in hard-fought, two-hour finals event <p>
 

(Denver, Colorado)  &#8211; Tom Schmidlin, a 36-year-old University of Washington graduate student, devout homebrewer and yeast enthusiast, won the 2006 Beerdrinker of the Year title in Denver on Saturday, Feb 25.  In a two-hour session packed with difficult beer questions from a panel of seven judges, Schmidlin used an intense knowledge of beer, a quick wit, and some impressive bribes to land the 2006 crown.   In addition to winning the coveted Beerdrinker of the Year title, Schmidlin won $250 worth of beer at his local brewpub (Big Time Brewery & Alehouse, in Seattle, Washington) and free beer for life at the Wynkoop Brewing Company. "I&#8217;m moving to Denver," Schmidlin joked in his acceptance speech.<p>Schmidlin held off serious challenges from the other 2006 finalists, Diane Catanzaro, (a Norfolk, Virginia homebrewer, beer judge and professor of industrial/organizational psychology at Christopher Newport University) and Warren Monteiro (a New York City playwright, script writer and devout beer hunter/educator). Schmidlin, Catanzaro and Monteiro faced a barrage of heady questions about their beerdrinking philosophies and the deep details on beer and its various styles, history, origins and more.<p>Schmidlin gained points in the "bribing of the judges" segment of the finals. A self-proclaimed "yeast dork," he provided the judges with samples of a yeast strain he isolated and cultivated from a bottle of Rogue Chocolate Stout. (A former mechanical engineer and computer programmer, Schmidlin has returned to college to study yeast and pursue a doctorate degree in biochemistry.) He also wooed the judges with a vertical tasting of three vintages of Dogfish Head Brewing&#8217;s Worldwide Stout. <p>In the competition&#8217;s beer whispering segment (in which contestants hold a conversation with a beer of their choice) Schmidlin drew big laughs from the judges and the audience with his conversation with a can of Milwaukee&#8217;s Best.  "I haven&#8217;t seen you in 15 years," Schmidlin said to the beer, which he and his fraternity brothers bought by the pallet years ago. "No, it&#8217;s not you, it&#8217;s me," Schmidlin said to the beer, explaining his reasons for not drinking "The Beast" in so long. "I&#8217;m different now, my tastes have changed." <p>His closing statement included a spoof of Lincoln&#8217;s Gettysburg Address. It lamented prohibition&#8217;s negative effects on America&#8217;s brewing culture, and celebrated the craft beer industry&#8217;s revival of American brewing.  "This is a tough competition and it&#8217;s intimidating," Schmidlin said after winning his title. "But it&#8217;s also a lot of fun and a big honor for me to win it."  <p>The resume review panel for the 2006 Beerdrinker of the Year search was comprised of the nation&#8217;s top beer writers and beer experts, and previous Beerdrinker of the Year winners.    The judges for the 2006 finals were Don Russell ("Joe Sixpack" beer columnist for the Philadelphia Daily News and host of "Joe Sixpack&#8217;s Happy Hour" radio show), Bill Metzger (publisher of the Brewing News newspapers) and Chris Black (proprietor of Denver&#8217;s Falling Rock Taphouse). The other judges were previous Beerdrinker of the Year winners John Marioni (2004), Gary Steinel (2002) and Ray McCoy (2003), and Charlie Dathern, a Buffalo, New York beer enthusiast and winner of the Brewing News&#8217; "Be a Beerdrinker of the Year Judge" contest. <p>The 2007 Beerdrinker of the Year search is now underway, entrants can send their beer resumes (in Word) to jamien@wynkoop.com.

RMC grad killed in Afghan battle<p>

The Whig-Standard and News Services
Local News - Thursday, May 18, 2006 @ 07:00<p>

The Whig-Standard and News Services<p>

The soldier killed in a firefight in Afghanistan yesterday was a recent Royal Military College graduate flagged as one of the Forces&#8217; best and brightest young officers.<p> 

Capt. Nichola Goddard, 26, a combat engineer with the 1st Royal Canadian Horse Artillery based in Shilo, Man., was remembered fondly by local military people who knew her either from her time at the college, from which she graduated in 2002, or from participating in courses with her afterward.<p>

Goddard was killed in action 24 kilometres west of Kandahar. She was the country&#8217;s first female to die in combat since the Second World War. "I can&#8217;t tell you what a good person she was," said Maj. Anne Reifflestein, a division commander at Royal Military College who knew Goddard well from training her in Shilo and who was shaken at the news of her death yesterday.  "She was smart and brilliant and an excellent officer in the Canadian Forces. It&#8217;s a real loss to the Forces, and to the nation."<p>

While at Royal Military College, Goddard volunteered as a Scout leader with 4th Kingston Group, which met at St. Andrew&#8217;s Church.

Her fellow Scout leader was the cadet she would marry, Jason Beam. He has since left the military. The couple have no children.

Scott Barrett, who was district Scouts&#8217; commissioner at the time, said Goddard was warmly remembered by local Scouts and said for the couple to give up time to volunteer in the community while also meeting the heavy academic, sports and military demands of RMC was extraordinary.


&#8220;For the two of them to come off the campus and volunteer with a community organization was just incredible,&#8221; he said last night.

Goddard&#8217;s death devastated her friends and family back home.

Beam told CBC&#8217;s The National last night that her death had not sunk in yet, adding she&#8217;d called him just Tuesday excited about her coming mission.

She was due to return home in September, he said, and looked forward to it.

Goddard, who was a fitness buff and who was looking at competing in marathons and triathlons, was marked for &#8220;rapid future advancement&#8221; as an officer, a personnel notation reserved for the best and the brightest of the officer corps.

&#8220;I&#8217;m basically in shock,&#8221; said Reifflestein.

&#8220;Nick was the kind of person who would have made a difference. She was such a good person.&#8221;

Goddard was born in Papua, New Guinea, in 1980 and was living in Nova Scotia when she joined the military in 1998.

The circumstances of her death were not clear last night, but soldiers from the 1st Battalion of Princess Patricia&#8217;s Canadian Light Infantry, to which Goddard had been attached, were supporting an Afghan force by forming a ring around the battle area, said Brig.-Gen. David Fraser, commander of the multinational brigade based in Kandahar.

&#8220;We were there to back them up and support them, providing outer cordons. All the inner work was being done by the Afghan security forces,&#8221; Fraser said last night.

&#8220;There was a firefight out there and sometime during the firefight she was killed.&#8221;

Fighting had stopped last night, but Fraser said the operation was expected to continue today.

&#8220;Our hearts, our prayers and our sympathies go out to the family of Nichola Goddard,&#8221; said Fraser.

&#8220;It&#8217;s a hard day, but it&#8217;s also a day of achievements here. The government of Afghanistan and the Afghan national security forces have had a good successful day. There was significant Taliban casualties both killed and captured.

&#8220;Unfortunately, the cost today was the life of Nichola,&#8221; Fraser said.

Canadian forces were acting in support of the Afghan National Police and the Afghan National Army, who had received information that a large number of Taliban fighters were massing in the Panjwai district, about 24 kilometres west of Kandahar, an area that has seen off-and-on fighting for weeks, said Fraser.

Even as Canada&#8217;s mission was debated on Parliament Hill, Fraser said the commitment of Goddard and all Canadian soldiers has never wavered.

&#8220;This is an important mission,&#8221; he said. &#8220;This a mission that the soldiers believe in. This is a mission that the soldiers continue to go out every day and prosecute with passion.

&#8220;Nichola was doing a job that she loved. Everyone around me said that she loved what she was doing. She&#8217;s indicative of all the men and women serving over here in Afghanistan and Canadians should be proud of the work that their soldiers are doing in a very difficult environment.&#8221;

In Ottawa, Prime Minister Stephen Harper expressed the regret of a mourning country.

&#8220;Capt. Goddard died while helping to bring peace, stability and democracy to a troubled region of the world,&#8221; Harper said in a statement.

&#8220;She, and the other men and women who serve in Afghanistan, are involved in a difficult and dangerous mission. They are serving our country and its people with distinction. Our nation will not forget their sacrifice.&#8221;

Gov. Gen. Michaelle Jean, who is also commander in chief of the country&#8217;s military, added her voice to the regret last night.

&#8220;It was with deep emotion that I learned, upon my return from Haiti, of the death of Capt. Nichola Goddard in a firefight in Afghanistan earlier today,&#8221; she said.

&#8220;Capt. Goddard&#8217;s death reminds us once again of the risks that our Canadian troops, both men and women, face everyday in Afghanistan.&#8221;

Manitoba Premier Gary Doer also expressed regret.

&#8220;On behalf of the people of Manitoba, we respect her life of bravery and honour on behalf of Canada, and we offer our condolences to the family and to the community of Shilo,&#8221; he said.

Canada has about 2,300 troops in Afghanistan, most of them in Kandahar, as part of an international effort to help the Kabul government assert its authority and fight Taliban insurgents, who have been engaging the U.S.-led coalition and NATO forces in hostilities in many parts of the country.

Goddard has become the 17th Canadian killed in Afghanistan since 2002. One diplomat and 16 soldiers have died, including four killed in a friendly-fire bombing by a U.S. warplane.', '2006-05-18 14:34:35', '2008-06-12 14:46:58.401967', 0, true, true, true, 'kingstonwhig18', true);

WATERTOWN - On Saturday, the Watertown Wizards used back-to-back, walk-off singles to shock the Little Falls Diamond Miners in both ends of a doubleheader. In game one, Ryan Femath (St. Mary&#8217;s TX) singled up the left field line off Matt Bowman (South Dakota State), with two outs in the bottom of the seventh, giving the Wizards a 3-2 win. Gerry Spessard (Maryland) belted a one-out, bases-loaded single in the eighth inning to give the Wizards the night cap, 4-3. The sweep propels Watertown to 13-7, and the Wizards now have won eight out of their last ten games. The Diamond Miners fall to 9-8, having lost their last six inter-division doubleheader games. <p>Little Falls brought a 2-1 lead in the bottom of the seventh inning of game one. Matt Bowman started for the Diamond Miners and pitched effectively through the first six innings. After allowing a James Donaldson (Northeastern) lead-off single, Bowman forced Wes Henderson (Alabama) into a check swing, double play groundout. The Wizards were then down to their final strike with Dylan McMaine (Eastern Kentucky) at the plate. McMaine connected for a solo home run over the left field wall on a 2-2 pitch to tie the game. The game went downhill after that for Little Falls. <p>Pinch hitter Cody Pyle (St. Mary&#8217;s TX) hit a pop up in front of home plate. There was miscommunication between third basemen David Flores (Sacramento State) and catcher Ryan Overland (Fresno State). Flores attempted to make a last second catch, but the ball fell to the ground and Pyle was safe at first. A fielding error on Miners shortstop Tommy Fitzgerald (Fort Scott CC) kept the inning going and placed runners on first and second. Ryan Femath bounced a single up the third base line into left field, plating pinch runner Alex Jaffee to win the game.<p>James Donaldson led the Watertown offensive effort going 2-for-3 with one RBI. McMaine&#8217;s seventh-inning home run was his first of the summer. For Little Falls, Kyle Hartz (Santa Clara) was the hitting standout. Hartz went 1-for-3 with a RBI triple and run scored. David Flores contributed two hits and scored one run. <p>Matt Vieira (Cal State East Bay) earned his first win in relief. Vieira pitched an inning and a third of scoreless baseball and retired all four batters he faced. Jason Brown (Central Michigan) started for Watertown and earned a no decision. Brown pitched five innings and gave up two earned runs on four hits with one strikeout. Matt Bowman took the loss for Little Falls. He allowed three runs (two earned) on six hits and struck out three. Bowman, however, did set down 14 straight Wizards before the seventh-inning rally. <p>The Diamond Miners did not arrive to Watertown until 3:00 PM due to a scheduling mishap. The first game got underway at 3:50 PM and the Wizards jumped on top of the Miners in the first inning. With two outs, Gerry Spessard singled through the left side. Drew Madia (Purdue) connected for a base hit to right-center field, moving Spessard to third. James Donaldson lined a single into center field to score Spessard and put Watertown on top, 1-0. <p>The Diamond Miners would not strike until the top of the fifth inning against Brown. David Flores led off with a double to the left field corner. Ryan Overland (Fresno State) sacrificed Flores to third. Kyle Hartz tied the game at one with a RBI triple to the right field wall. Alex Bardeguez (Cal State Northridge) flied out to deep center field, driving in Hartz on a sacrifice fly to give the Diamond Miners a 2-1 lead. <p>The second game proved to be even more exciting. The Diamond Miners and Wizards went to extra innings, tied at three. Cody Pyle singled to lead off the eighth against Little Falls reliever Kyle Necke (Cal-Irvine). Pyle advanced to second on a Matt Davis (Eastern Kentucky) sacrifice bunt. Diamond Miners manager Kevin Tucker took out Necke in favor of right-hander Holden Sprague (Fresno State). Sprague intentionally walked Ryan Femath to set up a potential, inning-ending double play. Chris Rosenbaum (Tampa) hit a line-drive single into left field to load the bases, still with only one out. Gerry Spessard slapped a hard single past a drawn-in infield, driving home the game-winning run. <p>Spessard finished the game, 2-for-4 with one RBI. Cody Pyle tallied three hits in four at-bats and scored two runs. Chris Rosenbaum also contributed two hits and scored one run. Daniel DeMarco (Santa Clara) pitched two and two-thirds innings of scoreless relief to grab his second win. <p>Kyle Necke took the loss for Little Falls. He pitched three innings of relief, allowed one run on two hits and walked two. Joe Cravens (Hanover) started and lasted only three and two-thirds innings. He gave up a run on five hits and walked one. Kyle Schlecht (Charleston Southern) also pitched for the Miners. Ollie Linton (Cal-Irvine) paced the Diamond Miners offense with two hits and two RBI. Joe DiGeronimo (Wagner) had two hits as well. But, for all the Little Falls offense, they scored just three runs, stranded 13 runners base and could not take advantage of six Wizards errors. <p>Little Falls threatened in each of their first two at-bats. The Miners had runners on first and second when Watertown starting pitcher, Bobby Carrington (Northeastern), forced David Flores to ground into one of the three Diamond Miners double plays. With one out, Little Falls loaded the bases in the second inning on a fielding error, base hit and fielder&#8217;s interference. EJ Daws (Michigan State) hit into a fielder&#8217;s choice, eliminating the lead runner at the plate, for the second out. Then Carrington fanned Ollie Linton to end the inning, without allowing a run. <p>Watertown struck first in the bottom of the third. Cody Pyle smashed a lead-off, solo home run off Joe Cravens to give Watertown a 1-0 lead. Little Falls took the lead in the next half-inning. With one out, Kyle Hartz reached first on a Wizards throwing error. Joe DiGeronimo reached first on a bunt single, advancing Hartz to second. The Miners loaded the bases after a Kevin Fujii (Hawaii) fielders choice and an EJ Daws (Michigan State) walk. Ollie Linton smashed a ground ball up the left field line, scoring two runs, to put the Diamond Miners into the lead, 2-1. <p>The Wizards responded with two runs of their own in the fifth inning off reliever Kyle Schlecht (Charleston Southern). Chris Rosenbaum walked and Gerry Spessard singled. Alex Jaffee hit a chopper to third. David Flores fielded the ball, but his force-out throw to second went into the outfield, scoring Rosenbaum to tie the game. Schlect walked James Donaldson to load the bases for Watertown. Kyle Necke replaced Kyle Schlect on the mound. But, Necke walked Dylan McMaine to force home Watertown&#8217;s go-ahead run. <p>The Wizards allowed Little Falls to tie the game in the sixth against Bobby Carrington. An EJ Daws walk and Ollie Linton slash bunt single placed Miners on first and second. Tommy Fitzgerald hit a ground ball to the right side at first basemen Wes Henderson. Henderson fielded the ball cleanly, but his force-out throw to second sailed wide, and Daws came home to score, tying the game at three. After Carrington allowed runners to second and third, Daniel DeMarco was brought in from the bullpen. After an intentional walk to Jimmy Baker (Centenary), DeMarco quietly induced an inning-ending, around-the-horn double play to end the threat. <p>The Wizards return to Duffy Fairgrounds on Sunday afternoon.

WATERTOWN, N.Y. &#8211; Dylan Rees (R.I.T.) pitched a complete-game four-hitter and Gary Helmick (Towson) had two runs batted in as the Rochester Royals defeated the Watertown Wizards, 2-1, on Sunday afternoon at Duffy Fairgrounds. Watertown has lost two straight to Rochester and falls to 21-17. The Royals improve to 19-19 and win the season series from the Wizards, five games to three. More importantly, Rochester now trails Watertown for second place in the Central Division by two games. <p>Rees allowed just one Watertown hit through the first seven innings and forced the Wizards to leave five runners on the bases. Twice, Rees stranded the game-tying run on third base. Helmick batted in single runs for Rochester in the first and sixth innings off Wizards starting pitcher Bobby Carrington (Northeastern). Carrington took the hard-luck loss. He hurled a five-hitter over eight-and-two-thirds innings and surrendered two runs on five walks with three strikeouts. Carrington and Rees combined to force 32 groundouts. <p>Rochester never trailed in the game and took the lead in the first inning. Lead-off batter Henry Perkins (Columbia) was hit by a pitch and moved to third on back-to-back ground outs. Gary Helmick plated Perkins by legging out an infield single and Rochester had an early 1-0 lead. <p>Watertown nearly tied the game in the fifth inning. With one out, Alex Jaffee (Purdue) reached first on a Rochester error and stole second. Wes Henderson (Alabama) hit a chopper to the left side. Dylan Rees fielded the ball and went to put out Jaffee at third base, but no one was covering and Jaffee and Henderson were safe. After a failed suicide squeeze attempt by Watertown, Dylan Rees induced an inning-ending double play to keep Rochester ahead. <p>The Royals padded their lead in the next half-inning. Shawn Bailey (Monroe CC) walked with one out. Ryan Jablonski (Delaware) singled up the middle and moved Bailey up to third. Gary Helmick again used his speed to give the Royals their second run. Helmick beat out a potential double play ball that would have ended the inning, allowing Bailey to cross the plate. <p>Finally, Watertown broke through against Dylan Rees in the eighth inning. Back-to-back singles by Alex Jaffee and Wes Henderson (Alabama) put runners on first and third with no outs. Later in the inning, Chuck Eller (Wofford) slapped a single into left field to score Alex Jaffee with Watertown&#8217;s first run. A wild pitch by Rees moved pinch runner Ryan Walter (Peru State) to third and Eller to second. But, Rees forced a fly out and a ground out to hold the Wizards to one run. <p>Helmick finished 1-for-4 with two runs batted in and Jordan Petraitis (Miami OH) was 2-for-3 to lead the Royals offense. Chuck Eller went 1-for-4 with one RBI for the Wizards. Alex Jaffee has now scored three runs in Watertown&#8217;s last three games at Duffy Fairgrounds. <p>Monday evening sees the Wizards return to McDonough Park in Geneva, New York. The Wizards will play a make-up game against the Geneva Red Wings beginning at 7:30 PM. The home regular season finale at Duffy Fairgrounds will be on Tuesday evening.

I take your point, Alan. Land claims are complicated by all sorts of issues, most notably the radically different treaties contexts when traveling from Newfounland to British Columbia. Not to mention peculiar legal constructions such as the notion of "time immemorial". That said, I am after something simpler with this post. The same people who would deny Israel''s existence ignore not only a 3500 year continuous Jewish presence in the Holy Land they do so while ignoring the histories underlying their own mortgages or rental agreements.

Posted by: Ghost of a flea  at August 24, 2006 12:08 PM

Yes, quite right. My aside was of the most aside-y of asides.

On another one of a lesser aside-i-ness, I have a question about the right of any nation to existence that is difficult to frame without appearing to invite claims of anti-Semitism. I think there is a vast difference between a communtiy of culture and a present day nation and, especially where there are overlapping claims, the idea that absolute jurisdictional sovereignty eternal is, well, God given is not reasonable. I would invite consideration of the Scots and Quebec and other instances like the nations of Gaul in Roman times well before applying this to the mid-East. 

And please remember as I know you will that I am not considering this in anyway related to any group that would call for the slaughter of all the Welsh (or any other group) and frame that as the "existence of a nation" question. Genocide is bad. I am sure I am not the first to say that but I hold its truth close to my heart.

I have a question about the right of any nation to existence that is difficult to frame without appearing to invite claims of anti-Semitism.

Indeed. This is because the question is never posed of anyone except of the Jews.

Posted by: Ghost of a flea  at August 24, 2006 12:25 PM

See, I disagree entirely. Consider the Confederacy, the Welsh or Biafra. Nations that were denied.

Posted by: Alan McLeod  at August 24, 2006 12:30 PM

I have missed all those demos condemning the Welsh as blood-drinking Nazis. I believe you will find Wales on any map and its "denial" extends to tax-payer funded Welsh languange television and radio, Welsh-language schools and a national assembly. Somehow International ANSWER has overlooked its obligation to protest the occupation of Biafra alongside its erasure of countless (and uncounted) deaths in Rwanda, Darfur, Somalia, etc. etc. In fact, the only street protests from your list involve men in white hoods longing for their lost Confederacy. Your point will have some weight as soon as the United Nations screens Birth of a Nation with the same enthusiasm with which it denounces the Jews. Then again, given the rehabilitation of the Nazis in "progressive" circles I doubt the KKK can be far behind.

Some related unthinkable thoughts. The occupied territories were taken in war from Syria, Jordan and Egypt, countries whose pedigree as nation-states is hardly older than is Israel''s. Yet it seems only Israel which is to be forever considered a recent imposition on a landscape outside time. Meanwhile nobody speaks of a right-of-return for those hundreds of thousands of Jews ethnically cleansed from Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia, Libya, Egypt, Jordan, Lebanon, Syria, Iraq and Iran.

It is not that sovereignty cannot be argued about or disputed as a concept (I can provide some sources if you like). It is that the Jews are uniquely disinherited from it in the rhetoric of the "anti-war" left.

Posted by: Ghost of a flea  at August 24, 2006 12:44 PM

I think I have proven the difficulty of raising the point. Let me try again. 

For the existence of any nation to be a general principle it is independent of the moral claim of the community to nationhood. Just as we denounce the dream of Greater Serbia as a fantasy of a few so should we denouce the claims that Biafra was not a nation at the time or at the time that the Confederacy was not a nation. We should denounce it as it is not not a matter of moral claim but their military weakness that ended their nationhood. The results of the falling part of the Soviet Union shows certainly that you do not have to be swell to get to be a nation. 

Which leads perhaps to the question''s restatement. Do all nations have a right to existence? Or just the ones we morally align with? If the latter, we are accepting a questionable principle which means there ought to be a firmer principle behind it. It may be that nations have the right to self defend - which is entirely fine and good - and that has transferred into a right to exist.

Posted by: Alan McLeod  at August 24, 2006 12:55 PM

The difficulty of raising the point in the way you have is twofold. First, and for the second time, because it is off-topic to my post. Second, because you conflate "nation" and "nation-state" in ways which render your argument unclear.

If your point is that Westphalian notions of sovereignty have to be rethought, I can only agree. If your point is that the concepts of "nation" and "nationhood" are socially and historically contingent and often used in ways which are pernicious or opportunistic, I agree. But if your argument is founded on the phrase "right to exist" without acknowledging that concatenation of words is only ever applied to the Jews your argument is built on sand.

"Anyway it was a great weekend, with not many notable crows missing from the action (just you, Art, as well as Bill Gray (just moved back to Hfx), Simon, Dan Davis). "Saturday Rosann and I drove to Pictou, since 1) we heard there''s a new
Wal-mart there, and 2) Gary, Lindsay, and Marion wanted a drive. Conveniently, my early-90''s, no-frills automobile has little capacity to accomodate child car seats, so Rosann sprung for the gas. Later, after a few trips around town to exchange cash for red meat, room-temperature ales, and smokes, we were joined back at my place by Bruce, Elena, Colin & Rilla, Jake, BOA, Iain & Ellen, Crain, Buckwheat, Rob (albiet briefly), Roman & Heather. At approx 1:15, Al started his ''well what''re we going to do TOMORROW I''m kind of tired my my look at the time well TOMORROW is another day yawn yawn what''s that are you leaving already'' routine. Surprisingly, the place cleared out soon after. <p>Then on to soccer on Sunday. Lindsay showed remarkable patience on the sidelines (as did Heather, Ellen, Marion and Rosann) as 20 or so hungover,
out-of-shape (for the most part) crowmagnon men labored in the sweltering heat. We started out at Jube, but ended up moving to NSIT (larger field).
The stone-cold sober love train surprisinly was outscored by a hungover stumblefuck. This was the difference. Al never really got to see our end of
the field, as there appeared to be an invisible force field which delivered a rather painful shock if he attempted to cross back over half.<p>

"Then after soccer, the Lion''s Head for 23 breakfast specials (look carefully at the menu Al; anything other than this will take at least 45 minutes to prepare). Then a very refreshing swim in the lovely waters of Long Lake (nobody else within 2 km of us; that is, until Al proclaimed the body of water ''Lake Our''s''. Shortly thereafter,  several couples with children and dogs arrived).

"Anyway there should be no reason why we can''t plan this sort of occasion on an annual basis (of course, when you''re the host, there''s no airfare
involved). But seriously guys, we should give it a shot. A couple of crows suggested the Labour day weekend for next year... anyway we have a few days to think it over. Next year Lindsay should realize the significance of presenting the ever-sparkling Crow-Bowl to a grinning, toothless, sweaty team captain.

"Art notice carefully that as per the 71-72 Bruins our team had an assortment of alternate captains, but no captain. All for now crows...hope all''s well. Jart</blockquote><p>
What is significant is that on 7 September 1997 the trophy is the Crow Bowl and not the game itself.  Later that same day, JR wrote again:

<blockquote>Please forgive the barrage of messages Al...at soccer today Bruce and I were reminiscing about 10 on 10 soccer ie the crow bowl. I mentioned that you were going to have the words ''crow bowl''
engraved on the trophy; he suggested the French interpretation, ''le coupe de _______'' (sorry, but being from nordern N.B. I can''t remember the
translation for ''crow''). anyway sounds like a good idea to me....</blockquote><p>Not much discussion until the spring of 1998 when Fritz writes:

<blockquote>This "Crow Bowl" of yours sounds like a big event.  Was it named for our beloved Arthur?  Of course it must have been.</blockquote>

By the end of March 1998, I posted a long posting with much response called "People Who Know Al" Revisited".   At the beginning of the post, I described the short ''zine.<p>

<blockquote>...I would like to reinvent the concept.  I have bounced this idea off some of you in different forms.   I think the idea can be evolved to retaining the original concept of a vehicle for maintaining the contact and combine it with the success of the spread of email conversation.   It would, however, focus more on the practical issues affecting us now rather than just being a forum for just creative writing.   By doing this, I would like to try to structure the concept a bit with the hope of broadening and strengthening the appeal of staying in contact with the hope of...having larger parties with better wine in the future among other effects.<p>Accordingly, I suggest that we try to think in terms of three broad areas of activity by which we can participate according to everyone''s areas and depth of interest.<p>A number of social functions have already become annual events in the lives of people who know Al.<p>First, last year I lost badly - and those of you on e-mail will no doubt soon be signing up to kick my butt again - at the 1998 NHL hockey
playoffs pool.   Once we get moved into our new apartment and get the computer set up the invites will go out by what has been dubbed by Colin
as "Alnet."<p>Second, the success of the Crow Bowl 1997, "the Lindsay MacIsaac Invitational," has carried over in enthusiastic anticipation of the 1998 version, the "Baby Bowl" in honour of the flood of diaper fillers in the months since the first soccer match last August.<p>Set for 21 August, the event hopes to have as one of its highlights the North American debut of Mark and Katie''s dynamic duo of daughters, both
of whom, being European, can already no doubt run rings around most of us.   This is important as when we played last year we thought that if
we can keep it up sooner or later the kids will play and we will sip cocktails in the shade at the sidelines.<p>I wanted to get a Christmas Road hockey game going last year but the timing was poor.  I thought a winter equivalent of the Crow Bowl might work and still do.   Any thing else we can do?</blockquote><p>On Easter 1998, a dinner was held at the Birminham Strett Grill, Halifax, Nova Scotia, where we discused all this stuff out of which came the following post on 14 April 1998:

<blockquote>After the long weekend summit on People Who Know Al, the soccer discussions led to the following things being determined, besides the
fact that I want a new name for the stuff we do together:

<ul><li>For the regular weekly soccer, it is likely that it will move to Sunday evenings with Fisher arranging the games and getting the field. 
I thought it would be hard for me to go but I may not end up going on any weekend other than a long weekend so it doesn''t really mater to me.    Bruce-head should be thanked for all the work he''s doing. Someone want to do it?   I want him to find a licenced location with a tent and
stands...maybe one year.</li><li>The first special game is likely the 16th May or so game with the first good chance to have long distance turn-out.   Andrew MacDougall has said he is interested in showing up from Fredricton.  I wonder if Fritz can make it?  J.R. has suggested we have a beer and pizza night at his place during the playoffs.  I think doing both these things on the same weekend might be a good idea.  What do you think?</li><li>The next big game is the Crow Bowl likely now set for 25th July with
the parade of children at half time. The beauty of that date is that it is not in the same week that Ellen is due with our first child - Rilla''s
mother mocked me for the preivios date of choice in early September.  Better still is the party that Darren and Heather are going to have at
the Dalhousie Grad Club that evening a week before their wedding in PEI.   Heather on Saturday gave her approval to the joint event.</li><li>The last game is only a possibility right now.  I think after all
these years of playing it is time to take on Kings in an alumni game.   Dave Douglas is the coach.   We get all three Douglases, as many subs as we need and they have to provide a happy hour at the Ward Room. I think if we don''t give a crap who wins it might be fun.  Besides, Fish really
thinks he can stop an 18-year old striker from blasting one past him.  Criteria would be played for Kings in the 1980''s...who the hell didn''t!   I''m sure Sang took some long ditance courses when he was nine or so.   Should be in late September or early October...so maybe it''ll be really cold and no one will be able to kick the ball.</li></ul></blockquote><p>On June 15th the final confirmation of Crow Bowl 98 was sent out:

<blockquote>"The Crow Bowl is set for 25 July, Saturday afternoon in Halifax at the best field Fisher, J.R. or someone else can book.  The theme, after last year''s Lindsay MacIsaac Invitational, is the Baby Bowl so bring your
nippers for the half-time parade of the nation''s future.   Funny hats encouraged.<p>"After that, Darren and Heather have booked the grad club at Dal for a private party all we have to do is drink enough to make sure the bar covers the fee for the night.  At $300.00 I think we might just make it.   Bring your tapes and a healthy lust for beverages cold and hoppy.<p>"I am in possession of the Coupe des Corbieres and will accept donations over the big weekend for its engraving, mounting and sterilization.   As
the world cup plays out the week before and the stanley cup will be but a memory, I think this year''s cup is well placed to make a move on world
media.<p>"Rain or shine, be there or L-7 is your name."</blockquote><p>The final conversion to Crow-os-ity occured at the end of an e-mail dated 26 July 1998 setting out the events of the 1998 Crow Bowl game:

<blockquote>"We played like bouys and drank like fools.   Pretty much as we planned.   3-3 after 45 minutes and 6-5 for glorious blue over slimey, gangrenous green after a rather long second half extended by some pretty partisan time keeping by Darren.   A total of 20 or 21 I think played, no subs, in 26 or hotter temps on the south commons field near CBC television and the old vocational school - the new cornerstone of the NS Community COllege - the thing that looks like it was built by Hermann Goering as a provincial headquarters in Romania circa 1941.<p>The teams included - as I have a poor memory for those who played in our defensive end (I was never there!):

<ul><li>"Blue - Al, Fish, Chicken, Chisholm, Dave Swick, Lieth, "Eber" Wilson,
Crane, JR, Tallivaldus Folkins...(I know I am missing obvious people)...</li><li>"Green - Rob Douglas, Roman, "Dan-Dee" Dan Davis, Neil "the Real Deal" Robertson, Greg MacDonald, Gary MacIsaac, Ian "Hitman" Folkins...(again
missing the obvious)</li></ul></blockquote><p><img src="local/genx40/images/__hr_Team Photo 1998.jpg" class="center" alt="The best Crow Bowl for skills"><br /><i>Crow Bowl II at the Halifax Commons.</i><blockquote><p>Rob brought two teams worth of jerseys, I brought the game ball (a thoroughly politically incorrect NIKE) and, of course, the hallowed Coupe des Corbieres.    A total of $20 was donated to the Crow Bowl restoration fund.   Hopefully we can get at least the letters "CRO" engraved so we will know where we are going with the design.<p>Highlights.   JR lets one go through the five-hole.     I scored with my left foot.   Fisher evades the off-side rule throughout.    Dave Swick running more in the game than he had otherwise during the ''90''s.   No one was hospitalized.   For a second year a one goal difference and, with the time keeping, we actually took it half seriously.   Blue also gave up a penalty shot taking only a corner instead   (Maybe green will
have some of its own highlights).<p>Rob Douglas and Gary MacIsaac are 0-2 in Crow Bowl history while I am 2-2.   Rob will have to play until 2001 to even have a hope of passing me.<p>After the game we retired to the Lions Head for participation awards courtesy of Rob, outlining the history of "the Crow" from pre-history
through Watt/Jube to today.  We also partook of beer or two courtesy of the Garrision Brewing Company - as well as the odd Keiths.    We spoke
of Crow events to come: A Kings alumni game some Saturday afternoon this fall, a winter road hockey game.    We also thought of what we could add for next year:   enough players for subs, nets and a collection for flying in Rendek or Wank (40-50 per player). Lets get the cup restored
in time as well.<p>In celebration of the Crow Bowl, I am planning on submitting something
for Tidings once we get the team photos back.   Please fill me in on the whole line-ups and the Kings connectins of each.<p>We should also determine who should be the line up for a game against the Kings team (including all three Douglasses as well as some ''90''s alumni ringers), the terms of playing plus how much beer we have to buy Fisher to get him to stay in nets the whole game.   I think a challenge should be put to Kings before the end of August so lets start thinking of available dates.<p>Also the Al-net is hereby renamed the Crow-net and, as a bitter man once told me, you are all just a bunch of crows.</blockquote>
<p>After the game Rob Douglas handed out his history of the Crow Bowl which now I am happy I thought to hang on to despite the table of empty ales in front of me when it was handed to me.<p><img src="local/genx40/images/CBIIRD.jpg" class="center" alt="Heroes All!"><br /></div>', '2003-06-01 21:56:11', '2008-06-12 14:46:57.266731', 50, true, true, true, 'birthofthecrow', true);

<p>The silverorange Photo Gallery was originally designed as a simple one-gallery site when one of our developers went on a prolonged visit to <a href="http://gallery.whitelands.com/photos/england/">London</a>, England.  The concept quickly caught on and all the slices (and their friends) wanted a gallery.  The system was modified to allow for multiple galleries and the Gallery System was born.</p>

<p>After almost two years of use, the Photo Gallery System is now being prepared for a major overhaul.  Many of our clients also request gallery-type features for their sites, so the Gallery System has been a testing ground for new technologies and the new version will allow for greater flexibility in layout, site integration, and features.</p>

Subject:  Road Hockey Game<p>
A week Saturday is the annual road hockey game. Can we make it 1:00 pm at the same place - the tennis courts on Oxford Street near Young?  Also, how many are going to play?  As discussed, all activities other than ales after have been scrapped due to my over indulgence in organization. That being said, I will 
be travelling with at least five types of homebrew for sipping and encourage anyone who wants to try: India Pale Ale (6.5); American 
Wheat (4.5); Mild - if Ellen lets any go (3.6); Ordinary Bitter (3.6); overly hopped stout (3.5).<p>Alan <p>Date:  Sun Dec 23, 2001  9:53 pm
Subject:  Christmas! The break , the holiday, the project!<p>Christmas is here. I had the crappiest December due to actually being required to work dilegently. I even missed the office "go down to the boozer and fill your boots on the suits" party [putting together a 3/4 million dollar
costs brief (John Keith / Anne Gregory can explain)] for most of the month including last Friday from 8 am to 7 pm, December 21. <p>All apprehension and angst dissolved, however, with the fourth (?) annual Crow road hockey game. As the Grey is to the Stanley, so too is the Road Hockey to the Crow Bowl, lesser but full of reverence - perhaps it is the more elemental
event. Ten gathered at the tennis court at Oxford and Almon at 1 pm on the 22nd and we played for 1 and a half hours. Kindly, I was later told I played well. [I am sure the unspoken dependent clause was "for a big fat out of shape early middle aged guy".] Well, I did tip a Billy Grey shot into the net and did ok on set up passes. Two standouts in my mind. Rob Douglas clearly
had the Panasonic Play of the Game with a behind the back stab-grab save of a goal-line puck [very much a la Hasek]. Equipment of the game was Crane''s cup.  Grirded by crotch-placed plastic he was fearless in goal and defence doing the
splits in the face of a frozen ball meeting a beefy slap shot. <p>After the game we retired to JR''s to supp some of my home brew, the new
Propeller''s Porter and an experience which can only be said to put "late 30''s guys playing road hockey" into perspective - as being very reasonable! Rob presented JR with the full (or fullish) set of Spiderman cartoons from the late
60''s. We watched for 3 of the 18 hours we had available on tape. There in screen was the webslinger, the Green Goblin, the same bad skyline of New York and J. Jonah Jameson. In an unique yet subtle nod to plot, the second episode
actually sort of explained why JJJ hated Peter Parker: a break-in at his own home cast falsely on the man in blue and red. Most interestingly of all was the discussion that these movies were Canadian productions and that the voice of Spidermand and Peter Parker was Paul Soles who recently starred in "Death of a Salesman" at Stratford. Other voices were mainly from Wayne and Shuster with guest appearances by the guy who did Kraft commercials in the 70''s. One cop in the first year had a very "trained" English actors accent. By hour three we were switching over to Hockey Night in Canada and plans for downtown
were made. I went to be early having to get back to PEI noonish. Others headed downtown. </div>', '2003-08-10 00:09:23', '2008-06-12 14:46:57.500656', 110, true, true, true, 'newyearsroad', true);

On the way up we bought a case of Molson Stock Ale and maybe a sixer of Molson 
porter.<p>More about the porter in a moment, but it was the stock ale that was the eye-opener (so to speak) for me.  The scales fell from my eyes - 
this was beer!  Copper colored, malty, hoppy, rich.  Wow.  I could never go home again - at least not to Schlitz, which was my beer of 
choice at the time.  Unfortunately, it wasn''t exported, so I had to do with Molson Export Ale, which still wasn''t bad, but it wasn''t the 
same.  We made the trip across the Detroit River often until I started brewing a few years later.<p>Now the Molson porter - also very good.  LaBatt''s also made (and may still make?) "Velvet Cream Porter," which was a thin bodied, rather 
forgettable beer.  The Molson was not like any porters we may make as homebrewers - no real roasted grain flavor.  More like a Munich 
Dunkel.  I wonder if they used Porterine or some similar caramelized concentrate to darken it, or Munich malt.  As I recall, it was dark 
but not black, rich, caramelly, fairly sweet, but with some lightness of body that in retrospect I think came from corn.  No particular bitterness.  Maybe a little licorice.  It was used in old North American porters.  All in all, a good, interesting beer, if not my favorite style.<p>In his 1st edition of his Pocket Guide to Beer 1982, Perigee Books, later he went to Simon & Schuster), Michael Jackson gave it three stars.  He mentioned that it was brewed only Molson''s Barrie, Ontario brewery.  The porter had disappeared by the 1991 edition. Jackson also gave 1-1/2 stars to LaBatt''s porter, which is still brewed, and which he still scores the same.  The Molson Stock Ale he gave the maximum 4 stars in 1982, but it fell to 2 stars by 1988.  I 
don''t know if it fell in quality or he considered.  It retained 2 stars through the 6th edition, but isn''t mentioned the latest (7th). 
He gave the Export Ale 3 stars in ''82, but 2 stars in ''88.  It''s only 1-1/2 stars in the 7th.  How the mighty have fallen!  The porter was 5% abv, which would correspond to 1.050 OG or so.  I 
think if you used a base of Munich (N. American 6-row Munich, such as from Breiss, would be most authentic), some crystal and some corn (20-25%?), maybe a very little (1 oz)Carafa III or debittered black malt and some brewers licorice, you would get somewhere in the ballpark.  Around 20 IBU bitterness, and no hop aroma.<p>A search for recipes for another old-style North American porter, Yuengling, might give you some clues.
Here is a 1947 recipe from Nugey''s Brewers Manual for 100 barrels of 1.052 porter (divide by 620 for a five gallon batch, or maybe by 600 to allow for a homebrewer''s lower efficiency).  I think it might be a little more robust than I remember Molson.<p>

3300 lbs. 5-7L malt [this would be like Munich]<br>100 lbs. color malt<br>1075 lbs. caramel malt<br>1175 lbs. flaked maize<br>6 lbs. licorice<br>60 lbs domestic hops<p>Hope this helps.<p>Jeff<p>- -- <br>

<h4>MP contacts RCMP about e-mail written by woman blasting Martin</h4><p>
By Amy Smith / Provincial Reporter<p>

A Halifax woman who wrote that she wanted to spit in Paul Martin''s face says she didn''t mean to threaten anyone. Mary MacDonald, a disabled single mother, got a reply from the RCMP after sending an e-mail Wednesday to Halifax West MP Geoff Regan. In it, she wrote about the incoming prime minister''s $700-a-plate fundraising dinner the night before in Toronto, saying folks were dining on gourmet fare while there were huge lines at food banks. <p>

Mr. Martin was sworn in as prime minister on Friday. The final line of Ms. MacDonald''s e-mail said: "If I had the opportunity to do so, I would welcome the chance to spit in this man''s face." Mr. Regan''s office forwarded the message to the RCMP, who e-mailed Ms. MacDonald and asked her to contact them. She said she called the Mounties and spoke to someone in their national security investigation section. <p>

"It was a very unfortunate figure of speech that I used," a tearful Ms. MacDonald said Monday.  "Never in my wildest dreams did I think I would be talking to the police. I found myself in a very scary situation."  She warned other Canadians to be careful about what they say in public. "I will be curbing my letter writing and my e-mail writing in the future," she said.  <p>Even the telephone caused a problem. On Friday, Ms. MacDonald phoned the Hot Line call-in show on CJCH-AM in Halifax to talk about the situation. After going on the show, she said, she received a "cryptic e-mail" from the RCMP, saying they had heard her comments on the radio. The e-mail thanked her for "the publicity our national security investigations section has received as a result of your call." <p>On Monday, Ms. MacDonald said: "I wasn''t trying to thumb my nose at anyone." Sgt. Wayne Noonan, provincial RCMP spokesman, said threatening to commit an offence against an internationally protected person, such as Mr. Martin, is a crime under Section 424 of the Criminal Code of Canada and is punishable by up to five years in prison. <p>"If I''m going to say, ''I''m going to spit in your face,'' that''s a form of assault," Sgt. Noonan said Monday. "You can''t threaten to assault our prime minister." Sgt. Noonan said a record would be kept of the incident but that the RCMP do not plan to charge the woman.  "There''s no need to come forward with charges here," he said. <p>Jamie Carroll, a spokesman for Mr. Regan''s office, said the MP told him they don''t have the expertise to make threat assessments, which is why the e-mail was turned over to the RCMP. Mr. Regan, named fisheries minister on Friday, has called Ms. MacDonald to apologize for the way things were handled, Mr. Carroll said.   "We''re not happy," Mr. Carroll said. "We don''t like to see constituents harassed."', '2003-12-16 16:34:51', '2008-06-12 14:46:57.604772', 0, true, true, true, 'halifaxherald16', true);

<h4>Word of advice: Just don''t run Ms Stronach
Political arena will expose them all</h4><p>
Totnto Star 16 January 2004.<p>

DAVID OLIVE<p>

She will, of course, be torn to shreds.<p>

Belinda Stronach is set to confirm next week that she will seek the leadership of the Conservative Party of Canada.<p>

It''s not too late for her to reconsider, and avoid the embarrassment her father, Frank Stronach, suffered with his failed bid for a Commons seat in the 1980s.<p>

There are many ways unavailable to most Canadians by which Belinda Stronach, 37, can influence public policy. Hurling herself into the electoral arena is not the one best suited to her.<p>

An unhealthy media respect for multimillionaires and the conventions of political correctness has enabled the CEO of Magna International Inc. to craft for herself an image of business acumen and negotiating prowess in backroom politics.<p>

Fortune magazine ranks Stronach among the world''s most powerful businesswomen. The World Economic Forum, an annual celebrity summit usually held in Davos, Switzerland, tagged Stronach as one of its "Global Leaders of Tomorrow." A fawning press has alluded to her abiding interest in current events. Stronach is a "close friend of Bill Clinton."<p>

Enough said, apparently.<p>

Enough, in any case, for many moderate Conservatives and those hailing from Central and Atlantic Canada to latch on to Stronach as their best hope of keeping leadership frontrunner Stephen Harper from hijacking the newly merged Alliance-Tory party, and yanking it back into its Reform-era redoubt of right-wing nostrums and Western Canadian parochialism.<p>

Withdrawing from the race earlier this week, moderate MP Peter MacKay of Nova Scotia seemed to pass the baton to Stronach. She has, he said, "proven herself in the boardroom, she''s proven herself in the business world."<p>

But Stronach has done nothing of the kind.<p> 

This isn''t Canadian Idol.<p>

It''s a bid to run a G-7 country. Not for nothing did Harper launch his campaign this week promising a "Bloody Sunday." The polished Stronach image would not long survive the no-holds-barred scrutiny of electoral politics.<p>

I''ll try to be kind here. Stronach''s opponents won''t be.<p>

Scan the Stronach r&eacute;sum&eacute; and count the ways she''s vulnerable.<p>

She was born with a silver spoon in her mouth. She''s a college dropout. She''s not fluent in French.<p>

Stronach''s flirtation with Olympics reform and a couture house in Toronto are the hallmarks of a dilettante. She has never fought to replace a level rail crossing with an overpass, has never launched a think tank, a food bank or an arts group. Nada.<p> 

Leading as scripted a life as Prince William, Stronach''s paucity of major speeches and interviews has made her scarcely a spokeswoman for Magna, much less Canada.<p>

Stronach is a figurehead CEO at a company where she was previously occupied, for the most part, with "non-core" assignments in personnel and philanthropy. <p>

Having "joined Magna at birth," as she once said, and taken orders from company founder Frank Stronach her entire career, it''s fair to ask if Belinda Stronach will be her father''s puppet in Ottawa, as well.<p>

What prompts Stronach to join the race? <p>

"Citizens are encouraging me to run," she said this week. "Perhaps I could bring a fresh approach, a fresh perspective."<p>

That will have to be fleshed out a bit, likely at the urging of political sherpa John Laschinger, recently of the David Miller campaign.<p>

Between now and the leadership vote in March, Stronach will have to endure a crash course in Canada-U.S. relations, health-care reform, defence spending, gun control, same-sex unions, mad cow disease, the need to crack down on joint ventures like the pot plantation just discovered in Barrie, and the merits of the corporate welfare that brings Conan O''Brien to Toronto. <p>

Unavoidably, there will be a backlash from Conservative delegates in the West, which coincidentally is bereft of Magna auto plants and racetracks operated by Magna Entertainment Corp. Squaring the Stronachs'' gambling interests with the family values obsession of erstwhile Reformers will be an interesting exercise.<p>

Harper already gave a hint this week of the little-rich-girl taunts in the offing. He''ll find a heaven-sent zinger after perusing Anne Kingston''s 2002 magazine profile of the neophyte Magna CEO, which mentions the Andy Warhol silkscreen of Chairman Mao adorning one of Stronach''s former offices.<p>

Jack Layton is holding his fire, but wishing ardently for an official opposition leader named Stronach. <p>

For the NDP, it''s a question of where to start with Stronach, after achieving such populist success from its attacks on Paul Martin''s tax-dodging freighters.<p>

Let''s see: Magna''s own helpings of corporate welfare? Stronach''s $9.1-million CEO sinecure? Her father''s 19th-century take on corporate governance? <p>

With the ghosts of Joe Clark, Kim Campbell, Stockwell Day and other once-fresh faces haunting the campaign, Stronach will struggle at every church-basement appearance to justify the effrontery of her claim on delegates'' support.<p>

It will end badly. And Stronach will not have helped herself, the Conservatives, or the image of women in politics.<p>

The arena needs more brawlers like Sheila Copps, consensus-builders like Audrey McLaughlin, and astute administrators like Barbara McDougall. But until we develop an affirmative-action program, Leave No Heiress Behind, it''s hard to make a case for Stronach.<p>

By contrast, tycoons are welcome participants in the non-electoral aspects of the political process.<p>

Every New Brunswick premier of the past half-century, along with more than a few federal Liberal MPs in recent years, has collaborated with the Irving clan. And notables as varied as Pierre Trudeau and Barbara Hall have closeted themselves with members of the rival McCain family.<p>

Paul Desmarais'' Power Corp., Peter Munk''s mining and real estate companies, and Jim Pattison''s Vancouver conglomerate have nurtured budding politicians and taken them in from the cold after defeat or retirement.<p>

As a non-partisan do-gooder, there''s nothing to stop Stronach now from leveraging the Magna payroll in aid of her passions. The boards of Magna and associated companies boast more political diversity, clout and expertise than the average cabinet. <p>

Those currently and formerly on the payroll include Tory powerbrokers Brian Mulroney, William Davis and Mike Harris, prominent Liberals like Brian Tobin, David Peterson, Doug Young, Ed Lumley and Dennis Mills, and former Ontario NDP premier Bob Rae.<p>

Committing herself to projects rather than partisan politics, Stronach could model herself after Bill Gates'' life-saving missions in AIDS- and malaria-stricken Africa, taking up once again the developing-world humanitarian causes she adopted while married to former Olympian Johann Olav Koss.<p>

Those activities would be an extension of projects already within Stronach''s ambit. <p>

At her father''s instigation, Magna has for years sponsored ambitious scholarship programs, endowed university departments, funded community action groups, and sponsored the popular "If I Were Prime Minister" student essay contests.<p>

As a private citizen, Stronach is free to express her views to a parade of supplicants, a privilege denied to MPs hamstrung by the discipline of partisan solidarity. <p>

The groundswell of support for Stronach''s leadership bid is so subtle it has not announced itself much beyond the utterances of Magna retainers like MacKay, recipient of $100,000 in Magna funds for his Tory leadership bid, and Harris, a $75,000 Magna director.<p>

But if she put her mind to building a substantial inventory of good works, the time might yet come when far more citizens are encouraging Stronach to seek the mantle of political leadership than is now the case.<p>', '2004-01-16 16:48:26', '2008-06-12 14:46:57.613652', 0, true, true, true, 'totontostar16', true);

By Sarah Crosbie<p> 

Thursday, April 15, 2004 - 07:00<p> 

Local News - Four months after he graduated from Sheridan College&#8217;s art program, Cameron Tomsett was downtown at the Sleepless Goat Cafe when he saw a familiar face. <p>

Sitting in the Princess Street coffee shop, having a little lunch, was Tragically Hip guitarist Rob Baker. <p>

Tomsett stared at him and wondered if he had the guts to do it &#8211; could he interrupt the famous musician and invite him to his small art show? <p>

Could he? Should he? Would he? <p>

Collecting all his confidence, Tomsett nervously walked over to Baker and told him he had an art show just two doors down in a small space behind Wayfarer Books, and he would love it if he had time to check it out. <p>

&#8220;Knowing who Rob Baker is, and knowing the band has used Kingston artists before, and Rob Baker is obviously an art fan, I thought he might like to check my work out,&#8221; Tomsett said. <p>

Fast forward seven months. <p>

Tomsett, 23, is at his parents&#8217; Bayridge-area home, clutching a large mug of coffee. He&#8217;s drained it but the caffeine isn&#8217;t doing much to shake him out of his grogginess. <p>

It&#8217;s 10 a.m., and Tomsett went to bed six hours earlier. These days, there&#8217;s no time to sleep &#8211; he&#8217;s got to have his work ready for the Tragically Hip&#8217;s video shoot this week. <p>

In less than a year, Tomsett has gone from a straight-out-of-art-school, struggling-to-meet-ends-meet kid, to a bleary-eyed, exhausted artist working with one of the most popular bands in Canadian history. <p>

The cover of the new Hip album is Tomsett&#8217;s painting, In Between Evolution, a mostly yellow, orange and brown creation that is a collage-like work of 27 drawings combined. <p>

And when the local rockers were searching for a name for the new disc, they thought, Why not also use the title of Tomsett&#8217;s painting? <p>

In Between Evolution &#8211; The Hip&#8217;s 10th album &#8211; hits stores June 29. <p>

Tomsett gets credit for both the artwork and the title, but that&#8217;s not all. <p>

Things usually happen in threes, right? Tomsett&#8217;s work is also the inspiration behind the video for the Hip&#8217;s first single, Vaccination Scar. The tune has already been released to radio stations. <p>

Tomsett has created characters that will be props and animated creatures. <p>

The characters don&#8217;t have names. The only time Tomsett named them was when he scanned the images into his computer and needed to give them file names. They&#8217;ve got labels like Weird Guy 1 and Weird Guy 2. <p>

Tomsett wanted to keep In Between Evolution and the album cover under wraps until closer to the album&#8217;s release date in June but for a sneak peek, the Hip have put a portion of Tomsett&#8217;s painting on www.thehip.com. <p>

Baker said that after Tomsett asked him to check out his work, he finished his lunch at the Sleepless Goat and walked over to the studio. He was instantly drawn to Tomsett&#8217;s work. <p>

&#8220;He deals with weighty subjects in a playful, off-hand manner, and though he is as serious as a heart attack when it comes to his art, he doesn&#8217;t seem to take himself or much else too seriously,&#8221; Baker said yesterday. <p>

Baker was so impressed with Tomsett&#8217;s work, he immediately told his four bandmates about it and thought maybe, just maybe, the band had found itself some unique cover art. <p>

When the Hip were in Seattle recording tunes for the new album, Baker had Tomsett send his portfolio to the States so the band could look at his work. <p>

Truth is, the band&#8217;s first impression of Tomsett&#8217;s work wasn&#8217;t so hot. <p>

&#8220;The folio was underwhelming. It didn&#8217;t have the ones that wowed me,&#8221; Baker said. It seems the digital images didn&#8217;t capture the brilliance he saw that fall day on Princess Street. <p>

Later, when the Hip were back at their recording studio in Bath, Baker once again pushed for his bandmates to check out Tomsett&#8217;s work. <p>

&#8220;I said, &#8220;I&#8217;m really hot on this guy Cameron and I think we should have another look,&#8217; &#8221; Baker said. <p>

Second time was a charm. <p>

&#8220;Everyone was blown away,&#8221; he said. <p>

The plan now is for Tomsett to do three different pieces for the album&#8217;s cover &#8211; In Between Evolution, a prequel and a sequel. He&#8217;s also doing a piece for the back cover and is planning on doing a portrait of the band. <p>

Baker said Tomsett&#8217;s work will get a lot of camera time in the Vaccination Scar video while the Hip boys play a minor role. <p>

&#8220;We had talked as a band that we were getting tired of seeing our old tired asses up on the TV screen,&#8221; Baker said with a laugh. <p>

Baker said the band wasn&#8217;t scouting a Kingston artist but it&#8217;s nice that Tomsett is a Limestone City product, too. <p>

Other local artists have won attention, praise and awards for their work on Tragically Hip albums. <p>

Ian Hodkinson, who has taught art restoration at Queen&#8217;s University, did the art for the 2000 disc, Music@Work. <p>

Baker first saw Hodkinson&#8217;s work at a Kingston gallery and asked if he&#8217;d like to be involved with an album. <p>

Five years ago, local designer Andrew McLachlan won a Juno Award for best album design for the striking yellow-and-black cover of a piece of old electronic gear for Phantom Power. <p>

And sometimes, the Hip get one of their own to do the artwork. Baker did the watercolour painting for the cover of the band&#8217;s 2002 disc, In Violet Light. <p>

&#8220;I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s an ongoing concern where [Tomsett] is from but the fact is, I live here, so do three of the other guys ? It is a great added bonus, even an inside track, but it is not a prerequisite,&#8221; he said. <p>

Baker knows his art. This is how he described Tomsett&#8217;s work: &#8220;At first I couldn&#8217;t detect any overt influences, but now I see Arshile Gorky with a dash of Gary Larson and a pinch of Dr. Seuss &#8211; only the classics.&#8221; <p>

Gorky was an abstract expressionist and Larson created The Far Side cartoon. <p>

Tomsett admits his collaboration with the Hip almost didn&#8217;t happen because he nearly shied away from approaching Baker the day he spotted him at the Sleepless Goat. <p>

&#8220;I wasn&#8217;t sure if I should talk to him because I didn&#8217;t know if it was an invasion of privacy, but I did talk to him and I&#8217;m pretty glad I did,&#8221; he said. <p>

&#8220;I was very nervous. It was about a 20-second conversation.&#8221; <p>

Tomsett says if his career ended today, it wouldn&#8217;t be so bad. How many people can say they were the personal artist for The Tragically Hip? <p>

&#8220;I don&#8217;t know where to go from here. This is a good start and it would make a good end,&#8221; he said. <p>

&#8220;I would be perfectly happy if this is all I got the rest of my life.&#8221; <p>

Though he bumbled his way through his first chat with Baker, Tomsett said now everything is cool. The rockers are just like any other clients. <p>

Well, sort of. <p>

&#8220;I&#8217;m not too nervous around them. They&#8217;re really, really down-to-earth type of guys,&#8221; he said of vocalist Gord Downie, bassist Gord Sinclair, drummer Johnny Fay and guitarists Paul Langlois and Baker.<p> 

&#8220;There&#8217;s no ego with them, which is really cool.&#8221; <p>

Tomsett was a Hip fan before he got the go-ahead to do the album. He admits he doesn&#8217;t own every Hip disc and he points out that an early album like the fan favourite Road Apples came out in 1991 &#8211; when he was 10 years old. <p>

Like every good born and bred Kingstonian, Tomsett can list at least one gotta-love-it Hip song. <p>

&#8220;I have a fair share of their albums and listen to them quite a lot. I am a fan of their music,&#8221; he said. <p>

His No. 1 song pick is Springtime in Vienna from the 1996 album, Trouble At the Henhouse. <p>

Tomsett was born in Kingston and has an older and younger sister. He went to Lancaster Drive Public School and Bayridge Secondary School. <p>

He doesn&#8217;t ever remember a day he proclaimed, &#8220;When I grow up I want to be an artist! but he recalls always being the guy who was good at art. <p>

&#8220;In elementary school, kids would ask me to draw cartoon characters for them for school projects or just for fun and it kept going from there.&#8221; <p>

In one of his final years of high school, he took a special concentrated art program at Queen Elizabeth Collegiate and Vocational Institute. <p>

Karen Peperkorn taught Tomsett at QECVI.She immediately started singing his praises when asked what kind of student and artist he was back in his high school days. <p>

Peperkorn said Tomsett&#8217;s talent was obvious from Day One. Plus, she said, Tomsett is a leader and he&#8217;s mature but he&#8217;s also a funny guy who has a great sense of humour. <p>

&#8220;When Wallack&#8217;s wanted to hire him, I said, &#8216;He walks on water, what else do you need to know?&#8217; &#8221; she said. <p>

&#8220;I can&#8217;t tell you how much respect I have for him. He deserves the best. He&#8217;s a hard-working, strong, genuine person. To have him as a friend would be a real privilege.&#8221; <p>

After high school, Tomsett moved to Oakville to take a three-year art program at Sheridan College. <p>

After graduating with a degree in illustration last spring, he moved home to Kingston. <p>

Although it was tempting to live in Toronto, Tomsett thought moving home was the best idea &#8211; he could live with his parents, get a part-time job at Wallack&#8217;s Art and Drafting Supplies and work, work, work on his art. <p>

He has taken over his parents&#8217; basement and turned it into his studio. It was so packed with pieces and supplies for the Hip video shoot, he wouldn&#8217;t allow anyone a peek of his workspace yesterday. <p>

Tomsett did, however, mention a keepsake in his studio. Neither of his parents, Phillip or Janice, is artistically inclined but Tomsett knows where he got his talent. <p>

His grandfather, Selwyn Cooke, was an architect in Gananoque. Though he died when Tomsett was just a child, some of Cooke&#8217;s drawings are hung in the makeshift basement art studio. <p>

&#8220;He was a very good craftsman. I think my talent may come from that &#8211;if you can call it talent,&#8221; Tomsett said. <p>

Tomsett was nervous doing his first-ever interview this week. At first, he didn&#8217;t make eye contact and nervously wrung his hands and punctuated many sentences with, &#8220;That&#8217;s not really what I&#8217;m trying to say, but you know what I mean.&#8221; <p>

Much of his nervousness disappeared, however, when he started talking about his drawings and paintings. <p>

On his Web site, under his bio section, he said, &#8220;Confidence is more important than skill.&#8221; <p>

This is a guy, after all, who less than a year after graduating from art school has racked up a pretty impressive portfolio. He has not one but two album covers coming out this spring. <p>

As well as working on the Hip&#8217;s disc, local rockers Mystic Caravan hired Tomsett to design a cover for their sophomore album, Fly, due out soon. <p>

When he heard the band was working on another disc, he called the musicians and pitched the idea of creating a cover for the band&#8217;s new record. <p>

&#8220;There are a few album covers that have withstood the test of time. [The Beatles&#8217;] Sgt. Pepper&#8217;s really stands out to people,&#8221; he said. <p>

Tomsett admits it&#8217;s going to be pretty cool when he walks into a music store and sees two album covers with design credits to &#8220;C. Tomsett.&#8221; <p>

&#8220;I try and keep everyone&#8217;s image separate but the one thing that will unify them is my drawings,&#8221; he said. <p>

He also just won an award from American Illustration. In November, the organization will post Tomsett&#8217;s work on its Web site at www.ai-ap.com. <p>

Tomsett will likely hold a show in Kingston once he finishes his work with the Hip. Anyone interested in seeing his art now, can visit his online studio at www.tomsett.com.', '2004-04-16 02:55:00', '2008-06-12 14:46:57.676523', 0, true, true, true, 'kingston', true);

By JULIE FLAHERTY<p>

Published: April 19, 2004<p>


AMBRIDGE, Mass., April 18 - "This is my claim to fame," Ned Batchelder said as he held up a small cube of off-white paper. It all began on his Web log, or blog, last June, when he described how to make boxes out of business cards. <p>

While not a particularly fascinating bit of origami, the trick has become a tiny source of income. Thanks to references and links to the card cubes on other Web logs, the visitors to that page of his blog bring him about $2 a day in ad revenue. <p>

The on-line search engine Google, which places the classified-style ads on his blog, pays Mr. Batchelder every time someone clicks on one.<p>

"I didn''t get into this to make money," said Mr. Batchelder, a blogger from Brookline, Mass., whose business card cube is posted at www.nedbatchelder.com/text/cardcube.html.<p>

That was a refrain of most of the bloggers at Bloggercon II, a conference sponsored on Saturday by Harvard Law School''s Berkman Center for Internet and Society. But a hot topic was whether blogging would ever become a major source of income for large numbers of people. <p>

The blog watchers agreed that the vast majority of the estimated 2.1 million Web logs out there today would never even attempt to make money. But even now there are exceptions, like AndrewSullivan.com, DailyKos.com and PaidContent.org, and bloggers speak of them with reverence because of their profitability.<p>

"We all love doing this, and we want to be able to support ourselves doing it and make it work," said Jeff Jarvis, a journalist, blogger and president of Advance.net, an Internet strategy company.<p>

Blogs, which are frequented by only about 10 percent of people who use the Internet, are personal online journals where individuals can publish their thoughts on their businesses, their politics, their families or anything (and often everything) they please.<p>

In keeping with that spirit, the meeting was appropriately ad hoc, with no expert panels or keynote speakers. The participants - whether they had been posting for three weeks or five years - took turns voicing their opinions, snapping digital photos, recording videos, and, of course, blogging on their laptops through it all. <p>

Mr. Jarvis, who led a discussion on blogging as a business, has been watching all the ways that bloggers have managed to bring in a buck. Some bloggers have made money by selling books, T-shirts or CD''s on their sites. Some have tried selling access to individual articles or content through micropayments (99 cents for a poem, for example). A very few, like Andrew Sullivan, have made tens of thousands of dollars simply by asking for donations from loyal readers. <p>

But the most talked about route to profit was selling advertisements that pay by the month or by the number of blog visits. Boing Boing (www.boingboing.net), one of the most popular blogs on the Web with its musings by four freelance writers, is considering adding sponsors as a way to offset its server fees of about $1,000 a month.<p>

But observers wonder how advertising - the lifeblood of mainstream newspapers and magazines - will affect the grass-roots-sensibility of Boing Boing and other blogs. <p>

"It all comes down to personal integrity," Mr. Jarvis said. "If you trust and like and read Boing Boing because you trust and like and read it, there is no reason you wouldn''t continue to read them because someone is paying for their server."<p>

Bloggers, like Stowe Boyd, who posts at www.corante.com/getreal/, have no problem reviewing products with one hand and soliciting sponsors with the other. Mr. Boyd, who came to the conference from Reston, Va., makes most of his income as a consultant on collaborative technologies, but credits his blog with about $3,000 in advertising revenue each month. "They can''t get me to turn around and promote their product," he said. "It''s all my agenda."<p>

Before advertisers will flock to blogs, Mr. Jarvis said, bloggers will need to develop data on who is visiting their site, and how often. "I don''t want to blow up a bubble here and say this is going to be huge," Mr. Jarvis said." The beauty of it is it is small and it''s in the hands of the people." <p>

Henry Copeland, founder of BlogAds, a service that provides classified advertising for Web logs, is even more confident. He predicted that blogs that are making $5,000 a month will be making five or six times that a year from now. Soon, advertisers will be able to say "I want to buy ads on 25 different Web logs in Southern California written by women who drive humvees," and have the perfect audience at their fingertips, he said. <p>

Many participants said that their Web logs had made them money indirectly, through promoting their businesses. Some credit blogs with helping to increase their consulting work. Some say blogs have helped lead to book deals, freelance writing jobs or lecture tours. <p>

J. Craig Williams, a lawyer in Newport Beach, Calif., began his Web log, MayItPleaseTheCourt.net, in August. He said his postings, which focus on his particular area of law, have brought him hundreds of thousands of dollars'' worth of legal business. <p>

But talk of money leaves a bad taste in the mouth of some bloggers. Some participants were far more interested in talking about the role of blogging in politics and religion. A heated discussion arose over whether blogging is journalism. And many wondered if there is room for little-known blogs ever to make the ''A'' list.', '2004-04-21 14:22:20', '2008-06-12 14:46:57.682563', 0, true, true, true, 'newyorktimes19', true);

<p>I often wonder who that scowling fellow is with his arms behind his back, perpetually pacing outside the Spring Garden library. You know, that bald guy with beetle brows and stucco pants. <p>Pa was forever quoting him, even on his deathbed when he croaked these last words: &#8220;Politics are almost as exciting as war, and quite as dangerous. In war, you can only be killed once, but in politics many times.&#8221; I was so numb when Pa kicked off that I failed to appreciate that profound quote from Mr. Stucco Pants until this week when I discovered that a former Green Party leader named Joan Russow and three high-profile colleagues had quit the Greens to join the NDP. Russow&#8217;s three colleagues sent blistering, bellicose letters to party members last October explaining why they were quitting. They accused the new Green Party leader, Jim Harris, of acting like a dictator.<p>
The letter from party secretary Karen Etheridge of BC complained that the Greens were becoming more a party of the right than of the left. &#8220;There is increasingly more emphasis placed on &#8216;fiscal responsibility,&#8217; opposing the labour &#8216;agenda&#8217; and support of business, and less upon social justice, democracy and realistic environmental solutions. The party is reflecting less of my core values, and taking on more ideas that I oppose.&#8221; In her letter, federal council chair Gretchen Schwarz of Quebec wrote she was joining the NDP because: &#8220;I no longer believe that the Green Party of Canada will realize the vision that I had hoped that it would. <p>As the party&#8217;s philosophy continues to shift further and further to the &#8216;right&#8217; of the political spectrum, I become further and further alienated from it.&#8221; The third letter from BC organizing chair, Julian West blamed Jim Harris for starting fights within the Green Party and making West a scapegoat: &#8220;I am resigning from council effective immediately. After I am gone, Jim will still be a sorry excuse for a leader, and people will see this and, without the scapegoat around, will themselves begin to question Jim&#8217;s leadership. Or else they won&#8217;t. I don&#8217;t really care.&#8221;<p>Over a phone line from Toronto, Jim Harris tells me he was elected Green Party leader just over a year ago. He says the high-profile resignations were &#8220;strictly a personality conflict&#8221; adding, &#8220;the people who quit the party were involved in obstructionism.&#8221; Harris acknowledges he was once a Tory worried about government deficits until he realized in the 1980s that the planet was carrying a crushing ecological debt with more species going extinct every hour. &#8220;So I shifted from being a fiscal conservative to being an ecological one.&#8221; When asked about his political philosophy, he says the terms &#8220;right&#8221; and &#8220;left&#8221; are irrelevant. &#8220;We say we are fiscally responsible, socially progressive and committed to environmental sustainability.&#8221; Harris is a 43-year-old motivational speaker who conducts seminars and writes books to help business leaders focus on change, &#8220;innovation&#8221; and &#8220;creating learning institutions.&#8221; He co-authored The 100 Best Companies to Work for in Canada&#8212;a bestseller that sold over 50,000 copies.<p>In the coming federal election, Harris says the Green Party plans to field candidates in every riding. If the party can attract at least two percent of the overall vote, it becomes eligible for hefty public subsidies under a new political financing law passed last year. Michael Oddy, who plans to run for the second time as the Green Party candidate in Halifax, says the party hopes the new financing law will result in a substantial increase in funding so that Greens can continue to press for sounder economic and environmental policies. Oddy will be running against the NDP&#8217;s Alexa McDonough who tells me that while she would never scoff at smaller parties playing a role in politics, elections are about winning seats in Parliament and not just about raising money. Besides, she says, the NDP itself has become a lot more green in the last few years. Oh yes, as old Mr. Stucco Pants said, politics is exciting and dangerous.

By Alan Mcleod<br>
August 2004, CBA <i>Privacy Pages</i><p>

There has been much discussion among municipal lawyers about the application of the Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act, SC 2000, c. 5 [&#8220;PIPEDA&#8221;] which came into general force on  Jan. 1, 2004, to the activities of municipalities. After all, don&#8217;t public-sector privacy laws already cover municipalities? The federal privacy commission has given indication that it may have little interest in pursuing complaints arising from violations of PIPEDA by municipalities. What is troubling about this position is that it does not appear to be well-founded in law, and could pose a risk to municipalities placing confidence in its protection.<p>

On a plain reading of PIPEDA, municipalities are indistinguishable from any other &#8220;organization&#8221; to which the Act applies. That term is defined to include a &#8220;person,&#8221; which, under the federal Interpretation Act, includes corporations, thus effectively including municipalities under Section 4 of Ontario&#8217;s Municipal Act, 2001.<p>

Further, municipalities clearly collect, retain, use, and disclose personal information on a regular basis. Personal information is defined under Section 2(1) of PIPEDA as follows:<p>

"personal information" means information about an identifiable individual, but does not include the name, title, or business address or telephone number of an employee of an organization.<p>

What is not required for data to fall into this definition is that the data be a comprehensive set of data about a person or that the data itself identifies the person. Partial data that can identify a person when combined with other data is also personal information. All it needs to do is &#8220;relate&#8221; to the person. Through their supply of services to citizens, municipalities are significant processors of this sort of data.<p>

Personal information handling only triggers the provisions of PIPEDA where the organization collects, uses or discloses in the course of commercial activities. Commercial activities are defined in section 2(1) of PIPEDA:<p>

"commercial activity" means any particular transaction, act or conduct or any regular course of conduct that is of a commercial character, including the selling, bartering or leasing of donor, membership or other fundraising lists.<p>

Prior to the introduction of PIPEDA, courts have confirmed the general principle that municipalities participate in commercial activities. (See, for example, Shell Canada Products Ltd. v. Vancouver (City), [1994] 1 S.C.R. 231 at para 11.)  As a result, it is fair to say the commercial nature of certain transactions triggers the application of PIPEDA to municipalities. It is important to remember that personal data is also received through many non-commercial transactions. The data received through non-commercial transactions are not included in the Act where those occur in the non-market context. These would include licensing, parking fines, rates and planning charges, as a municipality is an effective non-commercial monopoly in relation to these matters. These matters clearly do not fall under PIPEDA.<p>

Purchases of personal information through direct purchase or obtaining it indirectly as a part of procurements are identifiable municipal commercial activities. The acquisition of personal information through commercial supply to citizens is also a means to trigger the application of PIPEDA that should be appreciated. A municipality participates in commercial supply when it competes in a marketplace providing services that are also commercially available from the private sector. Consider each of the markets in which a municipality:
<ul><li>Operates an airport</li> 
<li>Operates a parking lot </li>
<li>Provides senior citizens housing  </li>
<li>Manages social housing tenant lists</li></ul> 
There will be differences from province to province in the scope of such municipal activities as well as many opportunities for municipalities to own or control corporations such as utilities that are also clearly subject to PIPEDA.<p>

In light of the above, the message that the federal privacy commissioner will not act upon complaints brought against municipalities is confusing. First, the basis in law for making such as assertion is unclear. The federal privacy commissioner has no statutory authority not to receive reasonable complaints relating to municipal breaches of PIPEDA. Further, the federal privacy commissioner does not control the process by which an individual complainant, unsatisfied with the position of the commissioner, brings a case to the Federal Court under s. 14(1), with the exception that the commissioner must first issue a report. <p>

It is unclear how the commissioner would respond to a reasonable complaint made against a municipality or a corporation related to a municipality other than issuing a report of some sort -- even if it is only based on the simplest of investigations confirming the complaint relates solely to a municipality and that, as a result, the commissioner will not proceed further. Once a report is issued, where the complaint is founded on one or more of the classes of breach of PIPEDA set out in section 14(1), the still-dissatisfied complainant is free to proceed independently to Federal Court without the consent of the privacy commissioner.<p>

Given that a complaint has this apparently-independent procedural avenue, it is prudent for municipalities to ensure that they are aware of PIPEDA and in reasonable compliance &#8211; if only to avoid becoming the test case before the Federal Court. The good news is this is not all-pain-for-no-gain, as a PIPEDA audit can save municipalities money in the long run. By reviewing personal information collection practices, municipalities may find that certain personal information gathering habits are not actually necessary. <p>

For the most part, municipalities already have designated officers to undertake this task under Ontario&#8217;s Municipal Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act or other comparable legislation in other provinces. It is also good human rights law that reflects the increasing demand on municipalities to use personal information, and the opposing pull from citizens to keep their personal information private in light of the increasingly intrusive capabilities of information technologies. As the point of the introduction of PIPEDA was to significantly diminish the unregulated commercial processing of personal information, leaving such a large gap as municipal participation poses problems.<p>

Supreme Court to rule on Oneidas.<p>
Rochester Democrat and Chronical,<br>

(October 3, 2004) &#8212; SHERRILL &#8212; The tallest building between Albany and Syracuse is the Oneida Nation of New York''s new luxury hotel at its casino, in the middle of farmland where Oneida and Madison counties come together near the Thruway.
The new skyscraper, scheduled to open this month, is a testament to the financial success of the Oneidas'' Turning Stone Casino, five golf courses, four hotels, three marinas, two campgrounds and 12 gasoline stations.<p>

Armed with casino profits and a federal court ruling that said the nation could buy back its former land and turn it into sovereign territory, the Oneidas have reclaimed about 16,000 acres.<p>

While they make hefty contributions to local municipalities and school districts, and their more than 4,000 employees pay taxes on their salaries, the nation itself doesn''t pay any local property, school or sales taxes.<p>

That has riled many in the area for years, but none so much as the tiny city of Sherrill, population 3,100.<p>

Refusing to accept two court defeats and saying the Oneida Nation owes the city about $40,000 in taxes, Sherrill is challenging Oneida sovereignty in the U.S. Supreme Court this fall.<p>

If Sherrill wins, American Indian land rights around the country could be curtailed, legal experts say.<p>

"It''s literally pulling the rug out from every treaty and every sovereign land title," said Robert O. Porter, an attorney, Syracuse University law professor and member of the Seneca Nation of Indians.<p>

If the Oneidas win, lawyers and historians say the effect probably would be limited to New York state and the other American Indian nations that have land claims here &#8212; but with potentially devastating impact on the tax bases of those areas. In Verona alone &#8212; the town that surrounds the Turning Stone casino and resort &#8212; nearly one-fifth of all the property is now non-taxable Oneida land.<p>

Using the precedent set so far in the Sherrill case, the Cayuga Nation of New York and the Seneca-Cayuga Tribe of Oklahoma have bought properties in their historical land claim area at the north end of Cayuga Lake. The New York Cayugas have opened three businesses, which they say are free of local and state regulation.<p>

David Vickers, president of Upstate Citizens for Equality, a group opposed to Oneida sovereignty, predicted "creative lawyers would take a look at it all across the country."<p>

"It can be a huge disaster" if the court makes broad changes, said Robert Venables, a Native American history expert at Cornell University. "If they choose to rule narrowly, it will be a small disaster."<p>

In a surprise to some, the Supreme Court agreed to hear the case against the advice of the U.S. solicitor general, the government''s top lawyer before the court.<p>

"That rarely happens," said Doug George-Kanentiio, a Mohawk journalist who is often at odds philosophically and politically with the Oneida Nation. "The Supreme Court saw something here that was of great interest to them. They are going to make a fairly decisive (ruling). This is not going to be ambiguous."<p>

The Oneidas, who onceranged over 6 million acres in central New York, possessed only a 32-acre reservation in Madison County when they launched their land claim in 1977. Their target was 700 acres, and the U.S. Supreme Court decided in a 5-4 ruling that they had a right to the land. The court also urged a negotiated settlement. But after the failure of on-again, off-again talks, the Oneidas in 1998 filed a new claim, this time seeking more than 250,000 acres. The basis of this and other land claims by the tribes of the Iroquois confederation is that by making its own treaties with Indian nations, New York state violated a 1790 federal law that required congressional approval of any state-initiated treaties.<p>

Since 1999, the land claim has been in the hands of federal mediators, who so far have been unable to forge a deal.<p>

"The problem comes in what''s the remedy," said Joseph Heath, a Syracuse attorney who represents the Onondaga Nation, another Iroquois tribe. "You can''t get your land back" because most of it is privately owned. Instead, "we''ll give you damages with the theory that (you use the money to) grow the territory."<p>

When the Oneidas acted on that legal theory, Sherrill objected. But both a federal district court judge and a federal appeals court held that the prior cases and treaties meant that the Oneidas could re-establish their sovereign territory &#8212; at least within the land claim area &#8212; by simply buying it back.<p>

If those Sherrill rulings are overturned, land claims that have already been ruled on &#8212; Oneida and Cayuga &#8212; might have to be revisited to consider a different remedy, Heath said. And future land claims, such as one the Onondagas are preparing that would cover much of Syracuse, and a potential Seneca land claim in the Genesee River valley, might seek actual return of their lands.<p>

"If someone steals your car, you ought to get your car back, not a hub cap," Heath said, explaining the legal logic.<p>

Among the properties the Oneidas bought were a total of 10 parcels comprising two blocks of land in Sherrill. The nation used one for a gas station and smoke shop and the other for a textile printing plant and smoke shop.<p>

"We think they are taxable," said Sherrill City Manager David O. Barker. "What we''re hearing is a self-proclamation that they''re not. We disagree with that self-proclamation."<p>

The Oneida Nation declined a request for an interview with tribal leader Ray Halbritter and issued only this statement regarding the case: "Two federal courts have already ruled in favor of the Nation, and the Nation is hopeful the Supreme Court will find similarly."<p>

Sherrill''s Manhattan attorney, Ira S. Sacks, argues that the land can''t be considered Indian territory because the title was extinguished when the Oneidas signed a federal treaty in 1788 saying they could sell their lands to the United States and later did sell to the state.<p>

Further, any remaining Oneida connection to the land was ended by the 1838 Treaty of Buffalo Creek, he said, a treaty that came out of federal policy of the time: Move the Indians westward to what are now Oklahoma and Kansas to make room for white settlers.<p>

"This is a bad treaty," Heath said of the Buffalo Creek treaty, which took two years to get congressional ratification and then passed by a single vote because of questions over whether it was a corrupt deal. "I''m surprised that people aren''t ashamed to argue from it."<p>

David M. Schraver, an attorney with the Rochester firm of Nixon Peabody, represents Madison and Oneida counties and filed a friend-of-the-court brief in support of Sherrill''s case. He argues that the federal law that required congressional ratification of states'' treaties was amended several times, becoming inapplicable in the Oneida case.<p>

While some dismiss the legitimacy of those arguments, they are concerned about what the Supreme Court might do.<p>

"I think both those claims are bogus and patently wrong," said historian Michael Oberg, a professor at the State University College at Geneseo. But "I think we''re on the eve of a potentially major rewriting of Indian history here."<p>

Sacks said that, at the least, the case "will have a big impact on the Six Nations of the Iroquois. A watershed impact on Indian law? Perhaps not." But then he added that the Supreme Court sometimes takes up cases to make watershed changes.<p>

Because the Oneida Nation buys land as it goes on the market, it owns a patchwork of properties in Madison and Oneida counties. There are no visible boundaries, for the most part, so no one knows which laws apply where, Schraver said. "It''s a very complicated and difficult situation."<p>

But town officials, who are used to dealing with federal lands and state Power Auuthority property within their boundaries, said that isn''t the main issue.<p>

"A lot of people say, ''I don''t care what they (the Oneidas) do as along as they pay their taxes,''" said Maurice Warner, town of Verona assessor.<p>

Mary and Ken Patrick are moving out of their house, which sits in a group of parcels surrounded by Oneida land on Sarenski Road in Verona. They have bought a new home in the town of Vernon because they are tired of living on what has become a shortcut from points east.<p>

"When we moved here, it was a quiet little district, and that''s changed," Mary Patrick said. Their new home will still be surrounded by Oneida land &#8212; but it''s undeveloped.<p>

Though they''ll be escaping the proximity to the casino, the Patricks are clearly bothered that they are governed by a different set of tax laws than their neighbors.<p>

Both retired from Oneida Ltd., the silverware manufacturer in Sherrill that recently announced it will suspend all domestic production. Mary Patrick ticks off all the taxes she and her husband have paid over the years. "When we went to work, we paid taxes on everything we earned. We paid taxes on our house, we pay property taxes every year," she said. "We either pay it or we can''t be here."<p>

She said she realizes that things change, and, like many people who have seen the local economy stagger, the Patricks acknowledge the positive impact the casino has made. But they also worry about its unchecked growth and trying to make amends for illegal treaties 200 years ago.<p>

On the left, James Carville and Paul Begala; on the right, Robert Novak and Tucker Carlson.  <br> <br>     In the CROSSFIRE: <br> <br>     (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP, "THE DAILY SHOW WITH JON STEWART")  <br> <br>     JON STEWART, HOST:  To their credit, once they found out Cat Stevens, who is of Islam, was on the plane, they immediately called out the Air Force and had the plane followed by a (INAUDIBLE)  <br> <br>     (LAUGHTER) <br> <br>     (END VIDEO CLIP) <br> <br>     ANNOUNCER:  Are world events really a laughing matter?  They are if you''re Jon Stewart.  "The Daily Show" host comes out from behind the desk of comedy''s favorite news show for our full half-hour today on CROSSFIRE.  <br> <br>     (END VIDEOTAPE) <br> <br>     ANNOUNCER:  Live from the George Washington University, Paul Begala and Tucker Carlson.  <br> <br>     (APPLAUSE) <br> <br>     TUCKER CARLSON, CO-HOST:  Welcome to CROSSFIRE.  <br> <br>     Less than three weeks before the election, we''re going to take a break from campaign politics, sort of.  Joining us will be Jon Stewart, host of "The Daily Show" on Comedy Central and co-author of a new best-seller entitled "America (The Book)."<br> <br>     PAUL BEGALA, CO-HOST:  We will spend the next half-hour with the most trusted man in fake news.  And he has got pictures of all nine Supreme Court justices naked.  <br> <br>     (LAUGHTER) <br> <br>     BEGALA:  Worth staying tuned for.  <br> <br>     First, though, we will begin, as we always do, with the best little political briefing in television, the CROSSFIRE "Political Alert."  <br> <br>     When he wants to look moderate, Dick Cheney invokes his lesbian daughter, Mary, on the campaign trail.  When Republican Senate candidate Alan Keyes viciously attacked their daughter, Dick and Lynne Cheney said nothing.  When John Edwards praised their evident love for their daughter, Vice President Cheney said this.<br> <br>     (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) <br> <br>     DICK CHENEY, VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  Let me simply thank the senator for the kind words he said about my family and our daughter.  I appreciate that very much.  <br> <br>     (END VIDEO CLIP) <br> <br>     BEGALA:  But now, suddenly, after four debate losses and 18 days until the election, the Cheneys are shocked, shocked, that John Kerry mentioned their daughter in a debate.  <br> <br>     There is an important lesson here.  If you''re gay and you want your rights protected by the Republicans, it helps to have a daddy who wants to distract the country from the millions he made from Halliburton, the billions he ran up in debt, and the war he lied us into.  <br> <br>     (CROSSTALK) <br> <br>     (CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)  <br> <br>     CARLSON:  I have to say, it takes -- it takes -- I admire your stones for defending the indefensible.  Even you know that it''s wrong, at the very least it''s unseemly, to bring up this guy''s daughter in two separate debates.  And the fact they didn''t get into an argument with lunatic Alan Keyes when he attacked their daughter proves nothing, other than they have good manners.  <br> <br>     (LAUGHTER) <br> <br>     CARLSON:  And the fact -- I''m serious.<br> <br>     BEGALA:  No, they have very good manners, Dick Cheney, sure. Really?<br> <br>     CARLSON:  What is he supposed to say when John Edwards says, hey, how''s your lesbian daughter?  <br> <br>     (CROSSTALK) <br> <br>     BEGALA:  He said thank you very much.<br> <br>     (BELL RINGING) <br> <br>     BEGALA:  Cheney has raised the issue in the context of campaign appearances.<br> <br>     CARLSON:  He has never a single time volunteered anything about his daughter''s sexuality.  <br> <br>     (CROSSTALK) <br> <br>     CARLSON:  And you know that that is true.<br> <br>     BEGALA:  August 24, 2004.  <br> <br>     (CROSSTALK) <br> <br>     CARLSON:  In response to a question.  He never a single time... <br> <br>     (CROSSTALK) <br> <br>     BEGALA:  He brought her up on the campaign trail.  <br> <br>     CARLSON:  Yes, I''m sure he did.<br> <br>     (CROSSTALK) <br> <br>     BEGALA:  That''s just the one that I -- yes, he did.  Check it out on Google.<br> <br>     CARLSON:  Yes, my lesbian daughter.  <br> <br>     (CROSSTALK) <br> <br>     BEGALA:  August 24, 2001.<br> <br>     (CROSSTALK) <br> <br>     CARLSON:  All right.  <br> <br>     Well, there are legitimate, even powerful arguments, to be made against the Bush administration''s foreign policy.  But those arguments are complicated, hard to explain, and, in the end, not all that sensational.  <br> <br>     It''s a lot easier just to make things up.  And so John Kerry has decided to do just that.  In an interview with "The Des Moines Register" yesterday, Kerry warned that there is -- quote -- "a great potential that Americans will be drafted into the armed forces if Bush is reelected president."  This is a total crock, as Kerry himself knows well.  Virtually no one favors returning to the draft.  <br> <br>     Bush is against it.  Congress is against it.  The Pentagon is completely against it.  It is not happening now or anywhere in the near future.  Again, John Kerry knows this very well, and yet he pretends otherwise in order to scare college students into voting for him.  And they probably will vote for him, but it''s still pretty dishonorable.<br> <br>     BEGALA:  Well, first off, what is Bush''s plan for helping out the Guard and Reserve?  <br> <br>     CARLSON:  That''s a separate... <br> <br>     (CROSSTALK) <br> <br>     BEGALA:  Kerry has a proposal to add 40,000 troops to the Army...<br> <br>     CARLSON:  You''re making a separate argument.<br> <br>     BEGALA:  ... Bush stretched past the limit.  What is Bush going to do?  What''s he going to do?<br> <br>     CARLSON:  Well, you''re making a separate argument.  You''re attacking Bush''s policy towards the National Guard and Reserves, which I think is completely fair and deserves to be attacked, frankly.  But there are no plans to reinstate draft because the Pentagon says that an all-volunteer Army is more effective.  It''s not going to happen, as you know.  <br> <br>     BEGALA:  Help me out, though.  The guy who says we''re not going to have a draft is the same guy who said there were weapons of mass destruction and there was a huge threat from Saddam Hussein.<br> <br>     (CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)  <br> <br>     CARLSON:  You know what?  <br> <br>     (CROSSTALK) <br> <br>     BEGALA:  Bush has no credibility, Tucker.<br> <br>     CARLSON:  It''s not simply the decision of one man, OK?<br> <br>     (BELL RINGING) <br> <br>     CARLSON:  It''s a decision that, in the end, Congress will make. And there is no possibility it will make that decision, as you know.<br> <br>     (CROSSTALK) <br> <br>     CARLSON:  Be see.<br> <br>     BEGALA:  We''ll see.<br> <br>     Terrorists exploded two bombs in the heart of heavily fortified Green Zone in Baghdad yesterday.  Another bombing killed another American soldier in eastern Baghdad.  Meanwhile, on the home front, the price of oil is hovering around $55 a barrel.  The Bush administration has hit the debt limit of $7.4 trillion.  They are using accounting tricks to keep the United States of America from going into default like a degenerate gambler with a bookie named Knuckles.  <br> <br>     We are critically short of the flu vaccine.  Health and Human Services says not to expect any vaccine from Canada, despite what President Bush said in the debate.  And yet our president thinks he deserves reelection.  In fact, he told reporters -- and I''m quoting here -- "I feel great about where we are."<br> <br>     Well, Newt Gingrich has a different take.  "If you don''t have some anxiety," the former speaker said, "you''re not in touch with reality."  Well, Newt, I couldn''t have said it better myself.  <br> <br>     (CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)  <br> <br>     CARLSON:  Well, of course, everyone has some anxiety, but that''s not the point Bush is making, as you know.<br> <br>     I found it actually really interesting.  There was a poll released today.  I''m not exactly sure what it proves, but it does say something interesting; 69 percent of members of the armed services right now support Bush, as compared to less than 30 for Kerry, and that overall they were far more hopeful about the direction the country is moving than the average person.  These are people, as you know, who are risking their lives in Iraq.  It''s not a defense of the Iraq policy, but it does say...<br> <br>     (BELL RINGING) <br> <br>     CARLSON:  It says something interesting about perspectives. <br> <br>     (CROSSTALK) <br> <br>     BEGALA:  It says that people in military are overwhelmingly Republican.  <br> <br>     (CROSSTALK) <br> <br>     CARLSON:  Which is an interesting question.  Why?  Why is that?<br> <br>     BEGALA:  Because the military has always attracted a disproportionate number of Republicans.  <br> <br>     CARLSON:  I wonder why, though.<br> <br>     (CROSSTALK) <br> <br>     BEGALA:  Well, first off, because they tend to poll the officer corps a lot more than the enlisted corps.  <br> <br>     Look at Michael Moore''s new book, "Letters From the Front: Will They Ever Trust Us Again?"  Those are enlisted people who have a very different view than the elite officer corps do.<br> <br>     CARLSON:  I''ll get right on Michael Moore''s new book.  <br> <br>     (LAUGHTER) <br> <br>     CARLSON:  Yes, definitely.  I''ll take it out of my local library.<br> <br>     BEGALA:  You should.<br> <br>     CARLSON:  Well, Winona LaDuke, remember that name?  Even to students of presidential politics, it might not immediately ring a bell, so here is a refresher.  LaDuke is the two-time Green Party candidate for vice president.  <br> <br>     Four years ago, she ran with Ralph Nader on the party''s stridently pro-hemp ticket.  A longtime Indian rights activist, LaDuke rarely joined Nader on the campaign trail, owing in part to legal difficulties she had with her common law husband.  He was head of the police at the time.<br> <br>     On one of the few occasions LaDuke did speak to the national press, she offered at least one policy proposal.  If elected, LaDuke promised to remove pictures of white people from the White House and replace them with portraits of famous minorities.  Down with George Washington.  Up with Grover Washington.<br> <br>     This year, LaDuke is working on a wind power project and will not be running for office again.  But in statement released this week, she declared that she''s no longer supporting Ralph Nader.  She''s supporting John Kerry.  Keep that in mind Election Day.  John Kerry, if he''s good enough for Winona LaDuke, he''s good enough for you.  <br> <br>     (LAUGHTER) <br> <br>     (CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)  <br> <br>     BEGALA:  Come on.  I mean, that''s... <br> <br>     (CROSSTALK) <br> <br>     CARLSON:  Someone has got to keep track of the celebrity endorsements here, OK?<br> <br>     (CROSSTALK) <br> <br>     BEGALA:  That would be like me saying David Duke endorses George W. Bush.  <br> <br>     (CROSSTALK) <br> <br>     CARLSON:  You''re missing it.  You''re missing it.  You''re missing it, Paul.<br> <br>     BEGALA:  The Duke family is all over the... <br> <br>     (CROSSTALK)   <br> <br>     CARLSON:  Day after day, you make the argument, look, Barbra Streisand is voting for John Kerry.  You should, too.  And I''m just saying, there are other people who are voting for John Kerry.  It''s not just Barbra Streisand.  It''s also Winona LaDuke.  <br> <br>     BEGALA:  You know, David Lesar, the CEO of Halliburton, I believe is for George W. Bush.  <br> <br>     CARLSON:  I hope so.<br> <br>     BEGALA:  So, you can go to Halliburton or you can go with David and Winona LaDuke, whoever they are.<br> <br>     CARLSON:  Winona LaDuke.<br> <br>     BEGALA:  I suspect they''re not related, actually.<br> <br>     (BELL RINGING) <br> <br>     CARLSON:  Well, he''s been called the most trusted name in fake news.<br> <br>     Next, we''re joined by Jon Stewart for his one-of-a-kind take on politics, the press and America.  <br> <br>     We''ll be right back. <br> <br>     (APPLAUSE) <br> <br>     (COMMERCIAL BREAK) <br> <br>     (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP, "THE DAILY SHOW WITH JON STEWART")  <br> <br>     STEWART:  Meanwhile, the president''s challenger was also in New York, also facing some difficult questions.  <br> <br>     UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  How to you stay in shape?  <br> <br>     UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Do you eat something?  <br> <br>     UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Do you have a routine?  Do you... <br> <br>     (CROSSTALK) <br> <br>     STEWART:  It''s like Nerf CROSSFIRE.<br> <br>     (END VIDEO CLIP) <br> <br>     (APPLAUSE) <br> <br>     BEGALA:  Welcome back to CROSSFIRE.<br> <br>     As both of our loyal viewers, of course, know, our show is about all left vs. white, black vs. white, paper vs. plastic, Red Sox against the Yankees.   That''s why every day, we have two guests with their own unique perspective on the news.  But today, CROSSFIRE is very difficult.  We have just one guest.<br> <br>     He''s either the funniest smart guy on TV or the smartest funnyman.   We''ll find out which in a minute.  But he''s certainly an Emmy Award winner, the host of Comedy Central''s "Daily Show" and the co-author of the new mega best-seller "America (The Book): A Citizen''s Guide to Democracy Inaction," at your bookstores everywhere.  <br> <br>     Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the CROSSFIRE Jon Stewart.<br> <br>     STEWART:  Thank you.  <br> <br>     CARLSON:  Thank you for joining us.  <br> <br>     STEWART:  Thank you very much.  That was very kind of you to say. <br> <br>     Can I say something very quickly?  Why do we have to fight?  <br> <br>     (LAUGHTER) <br> <br>     STEWART:  The two of you?  Can''t we just -- say something nice about John Kerry right now.  <br> <br>     (CROSSTALK) <br> <br>     CARLSON:  I like John.  I care about John Kerry.  <br> <br>     STEWART:  And something about President Bush.<br> <br>     BEGALA:  He''ll be unemployed soon?<br> <br>     (LAUGHTER) <br> <br>     BEGALA:  I failed the test.  I''m sorry.  <br> <br>     CARLSON:  See, I made the effort anyway.  <br> <br>     BEGALA:  No, actually, I knew Bush in Texas a little bit.  And the truth is, he''s actually a great guy.  He''s not a very good president.  But he''s actually a very good person.  I don''t think you should have to hate to oppose somebody, but it makes it easier.  <br> <br>     (LAUGHTER) <br> <br>     STEWART:  Why do you argue, the two of you?  <br> <br>     (LAUGHTER) <br> <br>     STEWART:  I hate to see it.  <br> <br>     CARLSON:  We enjoy it.  <br> <br>     STEWART:  Let me ask you a question.  <br> <br>     CARLSON:  Well, let me ask you a question first.  <br> <br>     STEWART:  All right.  <br> <br>     (LAUGHTER) <br> <br>     CARLSON:  Is John Kerry -- is John Kerry really the best?  I mean, John Kerry has... <br> <br>     (CROSSTALK) <br> <br>     STEWART:  Is he the best?  I thought Lincoln was good.  <br> <br>     (LAUGHTER) <br> <br>     CARLSON:  Is he the best the Democrats can do?  <br> <br>     STEWART:  Is he the best the Democrats can do?<br> <br>     CARLSON:  Yes, this year of the whole field.<br> <br>     STEWART:  I had always thought, in a democracy -- and, again, I don''t know -- I''ve only lived in this country -- that there''s a process.  They call them primaries.  <br> <br>     CARLSON:  Right.  <br> <br>     STEWART:  And they don''t always go with the best, but they go with whoever won.  So is he the best?  According to the process.  <br> <br>     CARLSON:  Right.  But of the nine guys running, who do you think was best.  Do you think he was the best, the most impressive?  <br> <br>     STEWART:  The most impressive?  <br> <br>     CARLSON:  Yes.  <br> <br>     STEWART:  I thought Al Sharpton was very impressive.  <br> <br>     (LAUGHTER) <br> <br>     STEWART:  I enjoyed his way of speaking.  <br> <br>     I think, oftentimes, the person that knows they can''t win is allowed to speak the most freely, because, otherwise, shows with titles, such as CROSSFIRE.<br> <br>     BEGALA:  CROSSFIRE.<br> <br>     STEWART:  Or "HARDBALL" or "I''m Going to Kick Your Ass" or...<br> <br>     (LAUGHTER) <br> <br>     STEWART:  Will jump on it.  <br> <br>     In many ways, it''s funny.  And I made a special effort to come on the show today, because I have privately, amongst my friends and also in occasional newspapers and television shows, mentioned this show as being bad.  <br> <br>     (LAUGHTER) <br> <br>     BEGALA:  We have noticed.  <br> <br>     STEWART:  And I wanted to -- I felt that that wasn''t fair and I should come here and tell you that I don''t -- it''s not so much that it''s bad, as it''s hurting America.  <br> <br>     (LAUGHTER) <br> <br>     CARLSON:  But in its defense...<br> <br>     (CROSSTALK) <br> <br>     STEWART:  So I wanted to come here today and say... <br> <br>     (CROSSTALK) <br> <br>     STEWART:  Here''s just what I wanted to tell you guys.  <br> <br>     CARLSON:  Yes.  <br> <br>     STEWART:  Stop.  <br> <br>     (LAUGHTER) <br> <br>     STEWART:  Stop, stop, stop, stop hurting America.  <br> <br>     BEGALA:  OK.  Now <br> <br>     (CROSSTALK) <br> <br>     STEWART:  And come work for us, because we, as the people...<br> <br>     CARLSON:  How do you pay?  <br> <br>     STEWART:  The people -- not well.  <br> <br>     (LAUGHTER) <br> <br>     BEGALA:  Better than CNN, I''m sure.  <br> <br>     STEWART:  But you can sleep at night.  <br> <br>     (LAUGHTER) <br> <br>     STEWART:  See, the thing is, we need your help.  Right now, you''re helping the politicians and the corporations.  And we''re left out there to mow our lawns.  <br> <br>     BEGALA:  By beating up on them?  You just said we''re too rough on them when they make mistakes.  <br> <br>     STEWART:  No, no, no, you''re not too rough on them.  You''re part of their strategies.  You are partisan, what do you call it, hacks.  <br> <br>     (LAUGHTER) <br> <br>     CARLSON:  Wait, Jon, let me tell you something valuable that I think we do that I''d like to see you... <br> <br>     (CROSSTALK) <br> <br>     STEWART:  Something valuable?  <br> <br>     CARLSON:  Yes.  <br> <br>     (CROSSTALK) <br> <br>     STEWART:  I would like to hear it.  <br> <br>     CARLSON:  And I''ll tell you.<br> <br>     When politicians come on...<br> <br>     STEWART:  Yes.  <br> <br>     CARLSON:  It''s nice to get them to try and answer the question. And in order to do that, we try and ask them pointed questions.  I want to contrast our questions with some questions you asked John Kerry recently.<br> <br>     (CROSSTALK) <br> <br>     CARLSON:  ... up on the screen.<br> <br>     STEWART:  If you want to compare your show to a comedy show, you''re more than welcome to.  <br> <br>     (LAUGHTER) <br> <br>     CARLSON:  No, no, no, here''s the point.  <br> <br>     (CROSSTALK) <br> <br>     STEWART:  If that''s your goal. <br> <br>     CARLSON:  It''s not.<br> <br>     STEWART:  I wouldn''t aim for us.  I''d aim for "Seinfeld."  That''s a very good show.<br> <br>     CARLSON:  Kerry won''t come on this show.  He will come on your show.  <br> <br>     STEWART:  Right.  <br> <br>     CARLSON:  Let me suggest why he wants to come on your show.<br> <br>     STEWART:  Well, we have civilized discourse.  <br> <br>     (LAUGHTER) <br> <br>     CARLSON:  Well, here''s an example of the civilized discourse.<br> <br>     Here are three of the questions you asked John Kerry.<br> <br>     STEWART:  Yes.  <br> <br>     CARLSON:  You have a chance to interview the Democratic nominee. You asked him questions such as -- quote -- "How are you holding up? Is it hard not to take the attacks personally?"<br> <br>     STEWART:  Yes.  <br> <br>     CARLSON:  "Have you ever flip-flopped?" et cetera, et cetera.<br> <br>     STEWART:  Yes.  <br> <br>     CARLSON:  Didn''t you feel like -- you got the chance to interview the guy.  Why not ask him a real question, instead of just suck up to him?  <br> <br>     STEWART:  Yes.  "How are you holding up?" is a real suck-up.  And I actually giving him a hot stone massage as we were doing it.  <br> <br>     (LAUGHTER) <br> <br>     CARLSON:  It sounded that way.  It did.<br> <br>     STEWART:  You know, it''s interesting to hear you talk about my responsibility.          <br> <br>     CARLSON:  I felt the sparks between you.<br> <br>     STEWART:  I didn''t realize that -- and maybe this explains quite a bit.<br> <br>     CARLSON:  No, the opportunity to... <br> <br>     (CROSSTALK) <br> <br>     STEWART:  ... is that the news organizations look to Comedy Central for their cues on integrity.  <br> <br>     (LAUGHTER) <br> <br>     (CROSSTALK) <br> <br>     STEWART:  So what I would suggest is, when you talk about you''re holding politicians'' feet to fire, I think that''s disingenuous.  I think you''re...<br> <br>     CARLSON:  "How are you holding up?"  I mean, come on.<br> <br>     (CROSSTALK) <br> <br>     STEWART:  No, no, no.  But my role isn''t, I don''t think...<br> <br>     CARLSON:  But you can ask him a real question, don''t you think, instead of saying...<br> <br>     (CROSSTALK) <br> <br>     STEWART:  I don''t think I have to.  By the way, I also asked him, "Were you in Cambodia?"  But I didn''t really care.<br> <br>     (LAUGHTER) <br> <br>     STEWART:  Because I don''t care, because I think it''s stupid.  <br> <br>     CARLSON:  I can tell.  <br> <br>     (CROSSTALK) <br> <br>     STEWART:  But my point is this.  If your idea of confronting me is that I don''t ask hard-hitting enough news questions, we''re in bad shape, fellows.       (LAUGHTER) <br> <br>     CARLSON:  We''re here to love you, not confront you.  <br> <br>     (CROSSTALK) <br> <br>     CARLSON:  We''re here to be nice.<br> <br>     STEWART:  No, no, no, but what I''m saying is this.  I''m not.  I''m here to confront you, because we need help from the media and they''re hurting us.  And it''s -- the idea is...<br> <br>     (APPLAUSE)   <br> <br>     (CROSSTALK) <br> <br>     BEGALA:  Let me get this straight.  If the indictment is -- if the indictment is -- and I have seen you say this -- that...<br> <br>     STEWART:  Yes.  <br> <br>     BEGALA:  And that CROSSFIRE reduces everything, as I said in the intro, to left, right, black, white.<br> <br>     STEWART:  Yes.  <br> <br>     BEGALA:  Well, it''s because, see, we''re a debate show.  <br> <br>     STEWART:  No, no, no, no, that would be great.  <br> <br>     BEGALA:  It''s like saying The Weather Channel reduces everything to a storm front.<br> <br>     STEWART:  I would love to see a debate show.  <br> <br>     BEGALA:  We''re 30 minutes in a 24-hour day where we have each side on, as best we can get them, and have them fight it out.  <br> <br>     STEWART:  No, no, no, no, that would be great.  To do a debate would be great.  But that''s like saying pro wrestling is a show about athletic competition.  <br> <br>     (LAUGHTER) <br> <br>     CARLSON:  Jon, Jon, Jon, I''m sorry.  I think you''re a good comedian.  I think your lectures are boring.  <br> <br>     STEWART:  Yes.  <br> <br>     CARLSON:  Let me ask you a question on the news.<br> <br>     STEWART:  Now, this is theater.  It''s obvious.  How old are you?  <br> <br>     (CROSSTALK) <br> <br>     CARLSON:  Thirty-five.       STEWART:  And you wear a bow tie.  <br> <br>     (LAUGHTER) <br> <br>     (APPLAUSE) <br> <br>     CARLSON:  Yes, I do.  I do.  <br> <br>     STEWART:  So this is...<br> <br>     CARLSON:  I know.  I know.  I know.  You''re a... <br> <br>     (CROSSTALK) <br> <br>     STEWART:  So this is theater.<br> <br>     CARLSON:  Now, let me just...<br> <br>     (CROSSTALK) <br> <br>     CARLSON:  Now, come on.<br> <br>     STEWART:  Now, listen, I''m not suggesting that you''re not a smart guy, because those are not easy to tie.<br> <br>     CARLSON:  They''re difficult.<br> <br>     (LAUGHTER) <br> <br>     STEWART:  But the thing is that this -- you''re doing theater, when you should be doing debate, which would be great.  <br> <br>     BEGALA:  We do, do...  <br> <br>     (CROSSTALK) <br> <br>     STEWART:  It''s not honest.  What you do is not honest.  What you do is partisan hackery.  And I will tell you why I know it.  <br> <br>     CARLSON:  You had John Kerry on your show and you sniff his throne and you''re accusing us of partisan hackery?  <br> <br>     STEWART:  Absolutely.<br> <br>     CARLSON:  You''ve got to be kidding me.  He comes on and you... <br> <br>     (CROSSTALK) <br> <br>     STEWART:  You''re on CNN.  The show that leads into me is puppets making crank phone calls.  <br> <br>     (LAUGHTER) <br> <br>     STEWART:  What is wrong with you?<br> <br>     (APPLAUSE)      CARLSON:  Well, I''m just saying, there''s no reason for you -- when you have this marvelous opportunity not to be the guy''s butt boy, to go ahead and be his butt boy.  Come on.  It''s embarrassing.<br> <br>     STEWART:  I was absolutely his butt boy.  I was so far -- you would not believe what he ate two weeks ago.  <br> <br>     (LAUGHTER) <br> <br>     (CROSSTALK) <br> <br>     STEWART:  You know, the interesting thing I have is, you have a responsibility to the public discourse, and you fail miserably.  <br> <br>     CARLSON:  You need to get a job at a journalism school, I think. <br> <br>     STEWART:  You need to go to one.  <br> <br>     The thing that I want to say is, when you have people on for just knee-jerk, reactionary talk...<br> <br>     CARLSON:  Wait.  I thought you were going to be funny.  Come on. Be funny.  <br> <br>     STEWART:  No.  No.  I''m not going to be your monkey.  <br> <br>     (LAUGHTER) <br> <br>     BEGALA:  Go ahead.  Go ahead.<br> <br>     STEWART:  I watch your show every day.  And it kills me.  <br> <br>     CARLSON:  I can tell you love it.  <br> <br>     STEWART:  It''s so -- oh, it''s so painful to watch.<br> <br>     (LAUGHTER) <br> <br>     STEWART:  You know, because we need what you do.  This is such a great opportunity you have here to actually get politicians off of their marketing and strategy.<br> <br>     CARLSON:  Is this really Jon Stewart?  What is this, anyway?<br> <br>     STEWART:  Yes, it''s someone who watches your show and cannot take it anymore.<br> <br>     (LAUGHTER) <br> <br>     STEWART:  I just can''t.  <br> <br>     CARLSON:  What''s it like to have dinner with you?  It must be excruciating.  Do you like lecture people like this or do you come over to their house and sit and lecture them; they''re not doing the right thing, that they''re missing their opportunities, evading their responsibilities?     STEWART:  If I think they are.<br> <br>     (LAUGHTER) <br> <br>     CARLSON:  I wouldn''t want to eat with you, man.  That''s horrible.<br> <br>     STEWART:  I know.  And you won''t.  But the thing I want to get to...<br> <br>     BEGALA:  We did promise naked pictures of the Supreme Court justices.<br> <br>     CARLSON:  Yes, we did.  Let''s get to those.  <br> <br>     (CROSSTALK) <br> <br>     BEGALA:  They''re in this book, which is a very funny book.<br> <br>     STEWART:  Why can''t we just talk -- please, I beg of you guys, please.<br> <br>     CARLSON:  I think you watch too much CROSSFIRE.  <br> <br>     We''re going to take a quick break.<br> <br>     STEWART:  No, no, no, please.<br> <br>     CARLSON:  No, no, hold on.  We''ve got commercials.  <br> <br>     (CROSSTALK) <br> <br>     STEWART:  Please.  Please stop.  <br> <br>     CARLSON:  Next, Jon Stewart in the "Rapid Fire."<br> <br>     STEWART:  Please stop.<br> <br>     CARLSON:  Hopefully, he''ll be here, we hope, we think.  <br> <br>     (APPLAUSE) <br> <br>     CARLSON:  And then, did U.S. soldiers refuse an order in Iraq. Wolf Blitzer has the latest on this investigation right after the break.  <br> <br>     (COMMERCIAL BREAK) <br> <br>     WOLF BLITZER, CNN ANCHOR:  I''m Wolf Blitzer in Washington.  <br> <br>     Coming up at the top of the hour, the Pentagon investigator a report that U.S. soldiers refused to go on a dangerous mission in Iraq.  We''ll have details.  In medical news, the FDA prescribes a strongly worded label on antidepressant drugs.  And why some experts think the flu vaccine shortage is a grim warning about U.S. vulnerability to bioterrorism.  <br> <br>     All those stories, much more, only minutes away on "WOLF BLITZER REPORTS."  <br> <br>     Now back to CROSSFIRE.  <br> <br>     (CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)  <br> <br>     CARLSON:  Welcome back to CROSSFIRE.  <br> <br>     We''re talking to Jon Stewart, who was just lecturing us on our moral inferiority.  <br> <br>     Jon, you''re bumming us out.  Tell us, what do you think about the Bill O''Reilly vibrator story?<br> <br>     STEWART:  I''m sorry.  I don''t.  <br> <br>     CARLSON:  Oh, OK.<br> <br>     STEWART:  What do you think?<br> <br>     BEGALA:  Let me change the subject.<br> <br>     STEWART:  Where''s your moral outrage on this?<br> <br>     CARLSON:  I don''t have any.<br> <br>     STEWART:  I know.<br> <br>     BEGALA:  Which candidate do you suppose would provide you better material?<br> <br>     STEWART:  I''m sorry?<br> <br>     BEGALA:  Which candidate do you suppose would provide you better material if he won?  <br> <br>     STEWART:  Mr. T.  I think he''d be the funniest.  I don''t...<br> <br>     (LAUGHTER) <br> <br>     BEGALA:  Don''t you have a stake in it that way, as not just a citizen, but as a professional comic? <br> <br>     (CROSSTALK) <br> <br>     STEWART:  Right, which I hold to be much more important than as a citizen.<br> <br>     BEGALA:  Well, there you go.<br> <br>     (LAUGHTER) <br> <br>     BEGALA:  But who would you provide you better material, do you suppose?<br> <br>     STEWART:  I don''t really know.  That''s kind of not how we look at it.  We look at, the absurdity of the system provides us the most material.  And that is best served by sort of the theater of it all, you know, which, by the way, thank you both, because it''s been helpful.  <br> <br>     (LAUGHTER) <br> <br>     CARLSON:  But, if Kerry gets elected, is it going to -- you have said you''re voting for him.  You obviously support him.  It''s clear. Will it be harder for you to mock his administration if he becomes president?  <br> <br>     STEWART:  No.  Why would it be harder?  <br> <br>     CARLSON:  Because you support... <br> <br>     (CROSSTALK) <br> <br>     STEWART:  The only way it would be harder is if his administration is less absurd than this one.  So, in that case, if it''s less absurd, then, yes, I think it would be harder.  <br> <br>     But, I mean, it would be hard to top this group, quite frankly.  <br> <br>     (LAUGHTER) <br> <br>     (CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)  <br> <br>     STEWART:  In terms of absurdity and their world matching up to the one that -- you know, it was interesting.  President Bush was saying, John Kerry''s rhetoric doesn''t match his record.  <br> <br>     But I''ve heard President Bush describe his record.  His record doesn''t match his record.  <br> <br>     (LAUGHTER) <br> <br>     STEWART:  So I don''t worry about it in that respect.  <br> <br>     But let me ask you guys, again, a question, because we talked a little bit about, you''re actually doing honest debate and all that. But, after the debates, where do you guys head to right afterwards?  <br> <br>     CARLSON:  The men''s room.  <br> <br>     STEWART:  Right after that?  <br> <br>     BEGALA:  Home.  <br> <br>     STEWART:  Spin alley.  <br> <br>     BEGALA:  Home.<br> <br>     STEWART:  No, spin alley.<br> <br>     BEGALA:  What are you talking about?  You mean at these debates?<br> <br>     STEWART:  Yes.       You go to spin alley, the place called spin alley.  Now, don''t you think that, for people watching at home, that''s kind of a drag, that you''re literally walking to a place called deception lane?<br> <br>     (LAUGHTER) <br> <br>     STEWART:  Like, it''s spin alley.  It''s -- don''t you see, that''s the issue I''m trying to talk to you guys...<br> <br>     BEGALA:  No, I actually believe -- I have a lot of friends who work for President Bush.  I went to college with some of them.<br> <br>     CARLSON:  Neither of us was ever in the spin room, actually.<br> <br>     (BELL RINGING) <br> <br>     BEGALA:  No, I did -- I went to do the Larry King show.  <br> <br>     They actually believe what they''re saying.  They want to persuade you.  That''s what they''re trying to do by spinning.  But I don''t doubt for a minute these people who work for President Bush, who I disagree with on everything, they believe that stuff, Jon.  This is not a lie or a deception at all.  They believe in him, just like I believe in my guy.  <br> <br>     (CROSSTALK) <br> <br>     STEWART:  I think they believe President Bush would do a better job.  <br> <br>     And I believe the Kerry guys believe President Kerry would do a better job.  But what I believe is, they''re not making honest arguments.  So what they''re doing is, in their mind, the ends justify the means.  <br> <br>     (CROSSTALK) <br> <br>     BEGALA:  I don''t think so at all.<br> <br>     (CROSSTALK) <br> <br>     CARLSON:  I do think you''re more fun on your show.  Just my opinion.<br> <br>     (CROSSTALK) <br> <br>     CARLSON:  OK, up next, Jon Stewart goes one on one with his fans... <br> <br>     (CROSSTALK)   <br> <br>     STEWART:  You know what''s interesting, though?  You''re as big a dick on your show as you are on any show.  <br> <br>     (LAUGHTER) <br> <br>     CARLSON:  Now, you''re getting into it.  I like that.  <br> <br>     STEWART:  Yes.  <br> <br>     CARLSON:  OK.  We''ll be right back.  <br> <br>     (COMMERCIAL BREAK) <br> <br>     BEGALA:  Welcome back to CROSSFIRE.

Yes sir, what''s your name, what''s your name?<br> <br>     QUESTION:  Hi, my name''s David.  I''m from Boston.<br> <br>     STEWART:  Hi, David.  <br> <br>     QUESTION:  My question is, what do you think the hump on G.W.''s back during the debate was?<br> <br>     STEWART:  Say it again?<br> <br>     QUESTION:  What do you think the hump on George''s back during the debate was?<br> <br>     STEWART:  The hump on his back?<br> <br>     BEGALA:  Oh, you''re familiar?  This is (INAUDIBLE) conspiracy theory.  Can I take this one?<br> <br>     STEWART:  Yes, please.  <br> <br>     BEGALA:  It was nothing, his suit was puckering.  A lot of people believe he had one of these in his ear.  If he was being fed lines by Karl Rove, he would not have been so inarticulate, guys.  It''s a myth.<br> <br>     (LAUGHTER)<br> <br>     BEGALA:  It''s not true.  There''s this huge myth out on the left.<br> <br>     (CROSSTALK)<br> <br>     BEGALA:  Yes, ma''am.<br> <br>     QUESTION:  Renee (ph) from Texas.  Why do you think it''s hard or difficult or impossible for politicians to answer a straight, simple question?<br> <br>     STEWART:  I don''t think it''s hard.  I just think that nobody holds their feet to the fire to do it.  So they don''t have to.  They get to come on shows that don''t...<br> <br>     BEGALA:  They''re too easy on them.<br> <br>     CARLSON:  Yes.  Ask them how you hold...<br> <br>     STEWART:  Not easy on them...<br> <br>     (CROSSTALK)<br> <br>     BEGALA:  ... saying we were too hard on people and too (INAUDIBLE).<br> <br>     (CROSSTALK)<br> <br>     STEWART:  I think you''re - yes.<br> <br>     CARLSON:  All right.

Local News - Tuesday, January 11, 2005 @ 07:00<p>

A sense of loss permeated City Hall yesterday. City workers learned longtime city chief administrative officer Bert Meunier died Sunday of an undisclosed illness.  He was 56.<p>

His family has asked that memorial donations be made to cancer research at the Kingston Regional Cancer Centre.  A &#8220;celebration of life&#8221; service is scheduled at the Scotland Funeral Home in Elgin from noon to 5 p.m. Saturday.<p>

Accolades abounded yesterday for an unflappable administrator who, in quiet fashion through two stints as Kingston&#8217;s senior civil servant, reshaped the inner workings of City Hall from the ground up.  Hailed by some as a visionary and pragmatist, Meunier relentlessly pushed for change on behalf of the taxpayer to bring accountability, efficiency and strategic planning to a municipality that critics claimed was paralysed by dysfunction and myopia.<p>

Intensely private and a man of few words, Meunier was remembered yesterday as a civic leader who gently inspired those around him to do their best for the city.  Frequently yesterday Meunier&#8217;s peers said he never lorded over the 1,400 employees in his charge.  The loss of such a high-profile public figure cast a pall over City Hall yesterday.  Staff members, assembled outside the late CAO&#8217;s empty office, wiped tears from their eyes as Mayor Harvey Rosen confirmed Meunier&#8217;s death in a news conference.  No members of the Meunier family attended the news conference, nor could they be reached last night.<p>

Rosen told reporters it was &#8220;with great sadness&#8221; that he delivered the news that Meunier had succumbed to an illness that forced him from his job in November.  It was only weeks ago that the city officially confirmed Meunier was ill. Many were shocked to see his life cut short.  Meunier had, in recent years, purchased a motorcycle and was a regular fixture heading up and down country roads between his city home and the Elgin summer farmhouse where he died Sunday surrounded by his wife, Frankie, and son, Jamie.  He played hockey, loved to run and was often seen walking his dog. Rosen said the city has lost a leader who guided the city through some challenging times.  &#8220;Mr. Meunier was an outstanding, experienced, dedicated municipal administrator who served our community well over 10 years and during times of unprecedented change in our city,&#8221; Rosen said. "Mr. Meunier was highly respected by council, staff and citizens alike and he will be sorely missed.&#8221;<p>

The municipality will offer its own special goodbye to Meunier, Rosen said.   &#8220;City staff and council are currently working on an appropriate tribute to a member of our municipal family who we all admired and respected,&#8221; he said.  &#8220;I would like to offer my sincerest condolences to Bert&#8217;s family during this most difficult period.&#8221;  Rosen said city treasurer Denis Leger will serve as interim CAO.<p>

Meunier&#8217;s loss wasn&#8217;t only felt in Kingston.  Word of his passing reached into municipal offices across the country where senior managers lamented the death of a man who served this year as first vice-president of the Canadian Association of Municipal Administrators.  Brian Hamblin serves as president of the association and is the City of Regina&#8217;s director of corporate services.  He said in an interview yesterday that Meunier was respected by 300 municipal managers across Canada for the forward-thinking changes he brought to Kingston.  Meunier was to be named national president of the municipal administrators association this May at the organization&#8217;s annual conference in St. John&#8217;s, Nfld.  &#8220;Bert was highly regarded in the municipal management field,&#8221; Hamblin said. &#8220;I would describe Bert as a consummate professional. Something I will miss about Bert is his quiet wisdom. He was definitely a strategic thinker and approached any issues or problems we were dealing with from a big-picture perspective.  He was a man of a high degree of intellect.  &#8220;On our CAMA board, Bert was assigned the project of working on our strategic plan for the next number of years,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We&#8217;ll miss him a lot.&#8221;   <p>Former mayor Helen Cooper worked with Meunier during his first stint with the city, from 1990 to 1992 when he left for Kanata.  Meunier returned in 1998.  Cooper said she was shocked to see an active man claimed by illness at such an early age.  &#8220;I&#8217;m profoundly sad that somebody so young and just a wonderful human being [has died]. He had complete integrity, a great sense of humour. It was quiet, so a lot of people may not have known it was there, but it was,&#8221; Cooper said.  There&#8217;s no question Meunier leaves Kingston better off than when he arrived, she said.  &#8220;Yes, he has a legacy, in that he was somebody who did want to change administrative practice at City Hall for all the right reasons and it was the fresh approach. There were some major stumbling blocks and he didn&#8217;t walk away from them at all, in fact quite the contrary. Bert was fearless in that regard,&#8221; Cooper said.<p>Former mayor Gary Bennett served with Meunier for one term in the late 1990s and said he liked Meunier the moment he met him.  Meunier wasn&#8217;t quick to jump to conclusions, a trait that made him a strong CAO, he said.  &#8220;I always admired and respected Bert&#8217;s judgment. If you wanted Bert to make a decision on the spot, he was very reluctant to do so, he wanted to make sure he clearly understood the issue from all sides, Bennett said. &#8220;Politicians are always quick at making decisions and Bert was never one who wanted to be involved in crisis management. He wanted to be sure that when he provided his advice, that council could rely on it, knowing it was well-thought out, that he was using his best judgment.&#8221;  Bennett said Meunier wasn&#8217;t a typical city CAO given the fact that he shunned the limelight.  &#8220;He was a bit of a contradiction. When one makes a decision to work in local government, particularly at the municipal level, it&#8217;s a very public office, a very public profile, everyone knows who the CAO of a city is ? and yet he was a very private person.&#8221;  Bennett said Meunier brought an immense intellect to the job, which helped cut through the maze of legislation and regulation.  &#8220;Particularly because of the fact we were one of those municipalities going through a fairly significant transitional process [amalgamation]. There aren&#8217;t any textbooks on the shelf on how to do it. In many ways Bert was helping to author the process of how one does that.&#8221;  Bennett said Meunier was no slouch and could often be found burning the midnight oil in his second-floor office.  &#8220;I left City Hall many nights at 10 p.m. and he was still there working,&#8221; he said.<p>Former mayor Isabel Turner said she was deeply saddened for Meunier and family.  Turner served with Meunier for one term until she was defeated by Rosen in 2003.  &#8220;I found him to be a very bright and intelligent man but a very humble man at the same time,&#8221; Turner said. &#8220;I have nothing but the highest praise for him.&#8221;  Turner said Kingston should be thankful for Meunier&#8217;s ability to see that the city needed a direction in which to invest its energies.  Focus Kingston, a community strategic plan, wouldn&#8217;t have begun without Meunier, she said.  When the document was implemented, Turner said, &#8220;you could see that starting to take life within the planning he was making with staff.&#8221;   Meunier was also a financial wizard who ensured there was ample risk management embedded in all city efforts, she said.  What struck Turner most about Meunier, however, was his honesty.  &#8220;He was always very straight with council. That is the real legacy for him. He just held this city in such high esteem in his own personal way. His intelligence, his experience. He put all of that into motion within the city,&#8221; Turner said.<p>Councillor Kevin George said the city was always in good hands with Meunier. &#8220;He was very forthcoming. There was no second-guessing what it was that he was trying to promote. It was always something better for the city,&#8221; George said.  There&#8217;s no question Meunier&#8217;s tenure in Kingston helped push the city toward a better tomorrow, he said.  &#8220;Bert was the one who made it very clear to us that we needed to deal with our budget long-term and to deal with capital projects that were forgotten about. There were the priority-setting sessions. There is no doubt in my mind that he was the one who drove this,&#8221; George said. &#8220;He has left a legacy and because of his initiatives, we&#8217;re a city that now realizes we can be proud of what we&#8217;re doing.&#8221;<p>Councillor Rick Downes said Kingston would have been in dire straits during amalgamation in 1998 if Meunier hadn&#8217;t agreed to return.   &#8220;Certainly, it took political will to bring the three municipalities together, but it was Bert Meunier who made it work, without question,&#8221; he said.  Downes said that Meunier&#8217;s constant quest for efficiency and accountability also helped form the annual report card issued by municipalities across Ontario. Meunier served on the provincial committee that saw municipalities report on the efficiencies of all city services from public transit to recreation.  The city will have a difficult road ahead finding a new CAO of Meunier&#8217;s calibre, Downes said.  &#8220;I&#8217;ve worked with people who hold similar positions to Bert&#8217;s and I think as a top administrator, he was among the very best,&#8221; he said.  &#8220;What Bert offered more than anyone else was a calm presence. He always commanded the respect of everyone because he was unflappable. We dealt with a lot of difficult issues over the six years and I never ever saw him upset about something. He took a lot.&#8221;<p>Councillor Steve Garrison extolled Meunier as someone who could find reason to end emotional and time-consuming arguments on council.  &#8220;Mr. Meunier was the calm in the storm. He kept his cool for the most part. He worked in a very political environment and had the skills and talent to run a major corporation,&#8221; Garrison said. &#8220;Sometimes things were very heated and emotional. Throughout it all, whether he was being lauded or criticized, he always handled things with a high level of dignity.&#8221;  Although Garrison and Meunier didn&#8217;t always agree, he said Meunier was a man who knew how to lead.  &#8220;He provided a stabilizing presence for his staff, I think,&#8221; Garrison said. <p>

Councillor Floyd Patterson said Meunier&#8217;s passing is a dark date in Kingston&#8217;s history, he said. &#8220;I respected Bert&#8217;s municipal training and his skills and his very competent intellect,&#8221; Patterson said.  Regardless of the complexity of an issue, Patterson said, Meunier was a master of boiling down issues and making them comprehensible.  &#8220;He had a wonderful ability to translate things into plain language,&#8221; Patterson said.  He lauded Meunier&#8217;s search for savings in the fall budget that resulted in managers cutting $1.7 million before the budget was even presented to council for approval in November.  Patterson said Meunier&#8217;s vision should also be praised for giving the city a long-term budget strategy to keep spiralling costs under control and avoid spiking property tax hikes.  &#8220;We have responsibility to follow up on that now, to screen that to see how effective it will be carried out,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Bert started that and understood what the taxpayers were concerned about.&#8221; <p> Councillor Beth Pater said the news of Meunier&#8217;s death is devastating for the city.  &#8220;I&#8217;ll miss Bert very much having worked with him for the last four years on implementing the community strategic plan,&#8221; she said.  &#8220;He was a wise and very professional administrator. It is a great loss to our city,&#8221; Pater said.<p>City commissioner of community services Lance Thurston said Kingston has lost a visionary.  &#8220;The legacy Bert has left for us is this financial model that is going to lead the city to sustainability over time,&#8221; he said.  Thurston said Meunier&#8217;s presence at City Hall will be felt for a very long time.  &#8220;As a city manager, to be able to leave that kind of legacy behind you is rather unique,&#8221; he said.<p>Cynthia Beach, commissioner of planning and development, said there is no doubt in her mind that Meunier&#8217;s experience helped guide the city to better times both inside and outside City Hall.  &#8220;Since Bert came to the city six years ago, there has been an absolute turn-around. It&#8217;s been Bert who was the driving force behind that. It was his thoughtfulness and pragmatism getting to the end goal. His signature is all over that and the city will benefit,&#8221; she said.<p>Interim CAO Leger said Meunier earned the respect of staff.  &#8220;Certainly, he was a very forward thinker, nothing short-term. He never ceased to amaze us. He was a mentor, a leader and well-respected colleague of ours.&#8221;  Leger said Meunier was always available to help despite an extremely heavy workload and timetable.  &#8220;He always had time for everyone in this corporation whether you were a front-line worker or a colleague on the executive team. Sometimes it wasn&#8217;t a lot of time but he always remembered your name. That was the kind of person Bert was,&#8221; Leger said.  Leger predicted that Meunier&#8217;s funeral service on Saturday will be teeming with people. &#8220;Bert was very modest and he may have thought not many people will show up for his tribute. I&#8217;ll tell you, there will be an awful lot of people because people looked at him as a modest and genuine person,&#8221; said Leger.<p>Operations commissioner Mark Segsworth said Meunier&#8217;s biggest wish would be for the city to complete his work.  &#8220;Bert would not expect us to miss too many beats over this one. We have to keep going. He was absolutely a man of integrity,&#8221; Segsworth said.  He said it was a shame that Meunier wouldn&#8217;t be at City Hall to witness the outcome of the many positive changes that were just begun in recent years.  &#8220;His legacy will materialize more as we move forward,&#8221; he said.<p>Former city councillor Don Rogers served for both of Meunier&#8217;s stints in Kingston.  He said part of Meunier&#8217;s success wasn&#8217;t only about his brains and vision.  Meunier also had style, Rogers said.  &#8220;Bert had a certain panache to him. I remember when he arrived at the city of Kingston, he would turn up wearing a flowing Australian drover coat and a very elegant wide-brimmed hat,&#8221; Rogers said. &#8220;In later years, you&#8217;d see him in his leather jacket getting onto his motorcycle, I don&#8217;t know whether there were studs on it.&#8221;  Meunier will be remembered for his casual coolness.  &#8220;He cut quite a figure and I think it&#8217;s significant when you can leave a mark, not just for the work you do, but for your style,&#8221; Rogers said.<p>Former city councillor and mayoralty candidate John Clements said he&#8217;ll remember Meunier as a good person.  &#8220;He was first and foremost a gentleman in the classical sense, he was person of character,&#8221; said Clements. &#8220;I was constantly in awe, especially sometimes [when] he took some really hard hits from the politicians and he didn&#8217;t retaliate in anything but a courteous manner.  &#8220;I think as a society he represents what we really appreciate in terms of human beings,&#8221; Clements said.', '2005-01-11 16:17:35', '2008-06-12 14:46:57.901834', 0, true, true, true, 'kingstonwhig11', true);

Views about Bert Meunier&#8217;s legacy in Kingston may differ but his goals were never in doubt.  He wanted to modernize the municipality and foster accountability with tools to gauge city spending, delivery of services and operations.   Fluently bilingual, the native of Granby, Que., studied at University of Montreal and later the University of Western Ontario.  He met his future wife Mary Frank (Frankie) during university.  His formal education completed,  Meunier began working at Gaspe College.<p>He then worked as recreation director in the Ottawa suburbs of Vanier and Gloucester before joining Quebec City in 1984 as an administrator.  His task in Quebec &#8211; to find savings.  Meunier introduced a new financial plan for the city of 165,000 and worked to build cost-saving measures from the ground up.  In five years, his plan helped cut Quebec City&#8217;s basic tax rate in half. The money saved was funnelled into economic development to lure new industry.  Former Quebec City mayor Jean Pelletier told The Whig in early 1990 that Meunier&#8217;s vision helped dig the city out of economic hardship.  &#8220;Bertrand Meunier is one of the key architects of the betterment of this city,&#8221; Pelletier said. &#8220;Not only did he make the budgeting process much better than it was before, he allowed us to keep control of our expenses all year around.&#8221; The city recognized Meunier for his work and appointed him as one of four deputy city managers. <p>The Canadian Association of Municipal Administrators gave him an award for management excellence.  In an interview with The Whig, he attributed the success of the budget reformations to solid planning.  &#8220;In city planning, the three most important things are priorities, priorities, priorities,&#8221; he said.  The promotion to deputy manager put him in line for the city manager position in Quebec City, but he chose instead to apply for Kingston&#8217;s chief administrator job when it became available in 1990.  &#8220;I&#8217;ve only been a deputy manager two years here [in Quebec City]. I feel that my natural career move is to be manager of a city the size of Kingston, rather than go over the heads of people here,&#8221; he said at the time.<p>Before his arrival in the city, Meunier said he was looking forward to bringing change.  &#8220;If people are going to solve their problems, they&#8217;re going to have to work together and that&#8217;s the key to this approach,&#8221; he said.  At a reception welcoming him to town April 19, 1990, Meunier warned his new employer that he wasn&#8217;t a miracle worker.  &#8220;I think people expect me to be able to walk on water,&#8221; he said.
&#8220;I didn&#8217;t work miracles in Quebec. I think my role was more co-ordinating the people who worked the miracles.&#8221;  Meunier&#8217;s enthusiasm and solid track record was met with a divided Kingston council, anti-francophone sentiment and attacks by some councillors as a result of his appointment behind closed doors. Councillors had hired Meunier in a secret ballot.<p>Then-councillors Bill Jamieson and Trevor Wilson said three city managers &#8211; city treasurer Rick Fiebig, city solicitor Norman Jackson and city public works administrator Ken Linseman &#8211; had applied for the job but were turned down.  Jamieson said people were phoning him asking why the city &#8220;was giving the job to Quebec people.&#8221;  Both Jamieson and Wilson were censured by council for publicly revealing the names of the three failed candidates.  Both councillors countered by asking the Ministry of Municipal Affairs to investigate the hiring.  The ministry concluded in November 1990 that Meunier&#8217;s hiring as CAO was proper, but that council had violated the Municipal Act by using a secret ballot.  Ministry official Dave Cooke said he felt &#8220;the decision is valid and that no action by the ministry is warranted.&#8221;  <p>Meunier quickly went to work, introducing a new budgeting system and setting city priorities through strategic planning.    He also guided council through capacity crises both at the dump and the sewage treatment plant.  Despite the successes, Meunier found himself in his second year advising a fractured council.  To outsiders it appeared a deep split had developed between councillors who supported Meunier and others still backing public works administrator Linesman.  Meunier was also attacked by councillors Ian MacInnis and David Meers, who claimed he failed to consult the city about a plan to restructure the public works department.  By October 1992, Meunier had his fill of Kingston. He announced he was leaving to accept a similar job in Kanata, a growing Ottawa suburb. <p>He rejected any notion he was leaving because of anti-French sentiments.  &#8220;I didn&#8217;t have any problem,&#8221; Meunier said. &#8220;I&#8217;m not saying there weren&#8217;t any bigots here, but because of the things in the paper about how certain councillors had felt about hiring a francophone, citizens and the business community went out of their way to be sure we felt welcome.&#8221;  Councillor George Stoparczyk fumed that Meunier may have been pushed from the job.  &#8220;Given the kind of treatment he was faced with by council in general, I can&#8217;t blame him,&#8221; Stoparczyk told The Whig at the time. &#8220;I wonder how he survived this long.&#8221;  <p>Six years later, in January 1998, the city dumped its sixth chief administrator in nine years &#8211; Rick Fiebig &#8211; as three communities merged to form a new, bigger city.  Kingston began the hunt for a new chief administrator &#8211; and it turned again to Meunier.  He came back to the city in the wake of a rancorous public debate about Fiebig&#8217;s failure to win the job.  Meunier refocused on his drive to modernize City Hall.  In an interview with The Whig on Aug. 6, 1998, Meunier said he&#8217;d learned from his highly political first go-round in Kingston and would apply his experience to the years ahead.  &#8220;I have learned to take a more low-key approach and to stay out of the political arena and keep to my role as an adviser and executor of public policy.&#8221; <p>Meunier&#8217;s term proved easier than he expected under mayor Gary Bennett, a university graduate in municipal administration.  One of Meunier&#8217;s first big challenges was a strike by 700 municipal workers in September 1998.  City Hall was shuttered as workers threw up picket lines.  Both the mayor and the CAO were publicly attacked for a city decision to hold a council meeting Sept. 22, in the midst of the strike, from which the public was barred.  Fearing that the meeting could be deemed improper, the city later repeated council session.  Meunier tried to reach out to unionized striking workers by picking up the tab for more than a dozen pizzas and handing out the free grub at City Hall.  He called it a &#8220;corporate gesture ? a show of support to employee morale and an indication that we&#8217;re still a corporate family.&#8221;  <p>After the strike, more controversy loomed.  The city selected a developer with an unproven record to build a proposed $211-million convention centre complex on waterfront property on Ontario Street. The Block D project polarized the city and led to power struggles between junior managers under Meunier.  The project was killed by the city in October 2000.  Two major shifts in city operations occurred amid the acrimony between senior city managers.   Councillors abolished standing committees in favour of a streamlined system under a committee of the whole, which Meunier said was inclusive.   &#8220;If you want to make representations, the best way is to be reinvented as a committee of council,&#8221; he said.  A committee of the whole would prevent standing committees and others from having a &#8220;privileged corridor&#8221; to council.  In November 2000, Meunier also brought forward a sweeping and controversial restructuring of the city&#8217;s bureaucracy.  Approved in secret session by councillors, Meunier abolished the department of strategic and long-range planning and created four &#8220;superbureaucrats&#8221; to manage massive departments.  The move did away with 12 senior manager positions at City Hall and saved money, Meunier said.  The removal of the strategic and long-range planning department as well as popular manager Mirka Januszkiewicz caused an outcry.  Januskiewicz later sued the city and settled for an undisclosed deal.  Some councillors claimed Meunier was &#8220;out of control.&#8221;<p>Other attempts to usher in new policy were also controversial.  Meunier issued a confidential memorandum advising senior managers not to speak to the media unless cleared to do so by in-house communications staff.  &#8220;It is preferable to co-ordinate key message statements through the communications unit, in consultation with the CAO,&#8221; Meunier wrote.<p>In December 2000, Isabel Turner was sworn in.  Her term was marked by turbulent council meetings rife with bickering and personal attacks.  Meunier stuck to his mission to create more responsive and efficient municipal services.  He criticized the city for what he saw as a slow-footed planning approval process that was driving away potential business.  &#8220;Companies can&#8217;t come to you and have you say the zoning is wrong and you&#8217;re going to take six months to do a public process and consult and this and that, because they&#8217;ll just go somewhere else,&#8221; he said.  Meunier also complained that the city&#8217;s roads, sewers and bridges had been allowed to deteriorate for years because past councils were bent on keeping property taxes low.  To properly dissect the city&#8217;s $250-million backlog of infrastructure projects, Meunier proposed in September 2002 to begin priority-setting sessions that would rate the importance of projects.  He asked councillors to rank 100 projects to get a sense of which ones should receive top priority. &#8220;There&#8217;s not on week that goes by that there&#8217;s not a new project and they are all important,&#8221; Meunier said at the time.  Meunier continued in the spirit of efficiency when he announced that fall that the city would review and weigh all city services in a quest for savings.  In December 2003, he watched as Harvey Rosen was sworn into office.  By 2004&#8217;s end, Meunier&#8217;s well-laid plans for a long-term budget process that protected city residents from sharp tax hikes were finally realized.  Working on the latest budget, city managers found $1.7 million in savings.', '2005-01-11 16:30:47', '2008-06-12 14:46:57.908701', 0, true, true, true, 'kingstonwhig111', true);

If federal Conservative Leader Stephen Harper imagines that he is deftly handling the question of same-sex marriage, he is fooling himself. His position is so untenable that 134 law professors sent him a letter this week reminding him how the law works.<p>

Mr. Harper insists that Parliament can ban gay marriage without invoking the notwithstanding clause. He said so last June: "If Parliament expresses its views clearly on this . . . then I am quite certain that the Supreme Court will understand that and respect Parliament''s competency to deal with such a matter." He said it again on Monday, dismissing decisions by courts in most provinces that the traditional definition of marriage is unconstitutional. "We have a long history of introducing legislation contrary to lower-court decisions," he said.<p>

What is going through his head? Perhaps he fears being perceived as a hypocrite if he advocates using the notwithstanding clause to override Charter rights, since he defended those rights when he led the National Citizens'' Coalition. In 2001, after an Alberta court agreed with him that the federal law restricting third-party election spending unreasonably violated the Charter, Mr. Harper said the court had "restored an important right for all Canadians and dealt a stunning defeat to those in the political establishment."<p>

Or perhaps he is worried that, if he used the heavy artillery of the notwithstanding clause to override the rulings of several provincial courts and exempt the law from the Charter, the Conservative Party would alienate potential supporters who aren''t comfortable with social conservatism. The Reform Party and its successor, the Canadian Alliance, had trouble making the electoral advances they hoped for in Ontario because of the social-conservatism tag.<p>

Whatever his motives, Mr. Harper is disingenuous when he says the Supreme Court of Canada wouldn''t intervene if Parliament adopted a clear law restricting marriage to a man and a woman. It is the judiciary''s job to interpret and enforce the Charter of Rights. Parliament and the provincial legislatures gave them that job a quarter of a century ago when they collectively entrenched the Charter in the Constitution. The only reason the Supreme Court hasn''t ruled on the existing definition of marriage is that nobody has given it a law to pronounce upon. All the Liberal government did was refer a few questions to it. The court said that if the government truly wanted the top court to issue a binding ruling, it should have appealed one of the provincial judgments that made gay marriage legal in those provinces.<p>

If Parliament were to pass a law prohibiting gay marriage, as Mr. Harper proposes, somebody would challenge that law in court the next day. Odds are, given the solid reasons of the lower courts, that the Supreme Court would strike down the law on similar grounds and that same-sex marriage would be legal nationwide. The only way Parliament can prevent that is to invoke the notwithstanding clause and renew it every five years. This newspaper does not believe the clause should be used in this case, but Mr. Harper is free to argue, as Cardinal Aloysius Ambrozic did last week, that it''s the right way to go.<p>

Instead, Mr. Harper builds castles in the air. He ducks and weaves. He talks of a slippery slope toward the legalization of "polygamy and who knows what else," mixing the apples of equality rights with the oranges of religious freedoms. He takes out advertisements saying the Conservatives would preserve the traditional definition of marriage even as he resists the instrument, the notwithstanding clause, that would accomplish that goal.<p>

Last June, just before the election, Mr. Harper refused to disown or apologize for a Conservative press release headlined "Paul Martin Supports Child Pornography?" He showed poor judgment, but the hope was that it was a misstep and that he would grow into the job of party leader. His unyielding insistence on ignoring the complementary roles of the courts and Parliament, and the obligations of both in the Charter age, suggests his judgment remains in question.', '2005-02-01 20:35:46', '2008-06-12 14:46:57.926954', 0, true, true, true, 'globeandmail26', true);

Devinder Singh isn&#8217;t accustomed to breaking up fights at his gas pumps, but that&#8217;s just what he did yesterday.  The manager of Petrostar, on King Street West, had to calm two customers who appeared to be on the verge of getting physical after one of them jumped the queue to the pumps.  "I calmed them down and told them to take it easy," said Singh as a steady stream of customers stepped up to his cash register.  "I said, &#8216;Cool down. You&#8217;ll get the old price anyway.&#8217;"<p>No wonder the two men were tense.  The Petrostar gas station was one of several across the city where people lined up for as long as 30 minutes to fill their cars amid rumours that damage caused by hurricane Rita would lead to jacked up prices as high as $2 a litre.  In some places, prices did rise. For instance, one gas station in Hamilton, Ont., raised the price to $2.15 a litre, and in nearby Grimsby the price rose to $2.02 a litre.  Rumours abounded yesterday that fuel prices would rise sky high as oil refineries in the United States closed &#8211; battening down their hatches against the monstrous storm headed ashore.<p>The 18 oil refineries around the Gulf of Mexico account for almost one-quarter of the refining capacity in the U.S.  Queen&#8217;s University economics professor John McHale said that even if those oil refineries aren&#8217;t damaged, prices at the pump will probably jump for a few days.  "We could get a substantial spike," McHale said yesterday.  "Much of the refining capacity is still out after Katrina; now additional refining capacity is being shut down."  The spike will be short-lived if the refineries aren&#8217;t seriously damaged by the storm.<p>Although Canada has a fair number of its own refineries, it will be affected by increased prices in the U.S.  "Even though Canada doesn&#8217;t really depend on the U.S. for its gasoline, it can certainly export Canadian gas to the U.S. and, if it can get a higher price in the U.S., it&#8217;s going to charge the higher price also to its Canadian customers," McHale said.  All around Kingston yesterday, panicked drivers blocked lanes, crowded intersections and slowed traffic on many roads as they waited their turn to fill up.   At midday, Singh was still selling some of the cheapest gas in the city for $1.03.9 per litre. He said he wouldn&#8217;t raise the price until he sold all the gas he had bought at lower prices.   "As soon as whatever we bought at the old prices finishes, that&#8217;s when we raise the price," he said as he handed change to a customer.  Around the corner on MacDonald Avenue, footcare nurse Lisa Butler-Patterson sat in her idling six-cylinder Grand Am.   The lineup in front of her blocked driveways along the small side street, frustrating residents who were trying to park on their properties. If gas goes up to $2 a litre, she said it will cost her more than $60 to fill her tank, up from about $33 before Katrina struck.<p>Gas prices leapt by as much as 25 cents a litre at some city gas stations after Katrina.  Butler-Patterson said she used to think nothing of driving off to Inverary to deal with a client, but as the cost of gas rises, she&#8217;s trying harder to lump trips to clients in the same areas together to save gas money.  She feels she&#8217;s in a catch-22. She can&#8217;t charge her customers more or they&#8217;ll go elsewhere. At the same time, she&#8217;s having difficulty being available when people need her.  "Some of my clients are going to have to wait or they&#8217;re going to call someone else," she said.<p>Wilfred Beaulieu, who was sat in line in his GMC pickup truck for several minutes to buy gas at $1.03.9 at Rosen Fuels on Cataraqui Street, said his business, Kingston Steeplejacks, is also feeling the pinch.  If gas goes up to $2 a litre, the price of filling his tank will go from around $60 to about $100.   "Profit is going down, taxes are going up, hydro and gas are going up, so we&#8217;re not getting ahead," Beaulieu said as his tank was filled.  About a dozen other cars lined up along Cataraqui Street behind him.  One of those belonged to Shireen Stroud, who drove a Nissan Murano. Ever since Katrina hit, she&#8217;s been filling up her car in $20 increments because it&#8217;s so expensive to fill it all the way.  Her family lives in the country and needs its vehicles, so Stroud doesn&#8217;t know how she can save money if gas prices skyrocket again.  "It&#8217;s a pain and an added expense, but I don&#8217;t know what my choices are."  Retiree Meryl Harper, who drives a six-cylinder Chevrolet Impala, said he&#8217;s already changed his lifestyle to deal with the effects of the higher cost of gas on his fixed income.  "Now I walk to the store and to the bank a mile-and-a-half away and I don&#8217;t take those long country drives that I used to on Sundays," Harper said.  <p>A drive around Kingston yesterday revealed that gas prices appeared fairly level at stations for most of the day. A midday survey found prices ranging from $1.03.9 at stations such as Petrostar and Rosen Fuels to $1.14.9 at the Olco gas station on Counter Street. Mid-evening prices hadn&#8217;t changed.  There was no lineup at that station around midday. But at the nearby Ultramar, more than 20 cars queued along the shoulder of Counter Street to take advantage of $1.03.9-per-litre prices.  Stations at gasoline alley on Division Street, near Highway 401, which were selling at around $1.04.7 per litre, were busy, but had no lineups.  According to Ontariogasprices.com, which maintains a real-time list of stations and their current gas prices as submitted by users of the site, pump prices stayed fairly level across the province for most of yesterday.<p>The Whig-Standard received a number of reports about area gas stations raising prices, but calls to the stations revealed the information was incorrect.  McHale said people may notice some wild variations in pump prices and he urged them to shop around and compare. Normally, consumers have a good idea of what the price of gas should be and this prevents gas station owners from increasing prices, but practices change during fuel crises.  "They [gas stations] know they can&#8217;t deviate too much from the going market price, but when you have a severe disruption like this, people lose the sense of what gas should cost," McHale said.   "They&#8217;re more willing to pay the high prices because they assume the price will be high elsewhere."<p>

With luck, Kingston''s Famous King will soon be home. 

Fouad Gharib, owner of the Famous King restaurant on Princess Street, is believed to have boarded a departing ship from Beirut yesterday after being stranded with his wife and five children in Lebanon''s Bekaa Valley since violence between Hezbollah and Israel broke out two weeks ago. 

Gharib''s cousin, Afif Gharib, told The Whig-Standard from the home of Fouad''s brother in Lebanon that Fouad and his family left the house yesterday afternoon after the Canadian Embassy informed them that a ship would be docking in Beirut to rescue stranded Canadians. "They told him to go to Beirut," Afif Gharib said. "Now they are gone." 

Supposedly, the only rescue boat being sent to Lebanon by the Canadian government was going to dock in the southern port city of Tyre yesterday. 

But Pamela Greenwell, a spokesperson with the federal foreign affairs department, confirmed that a second, smaller ship was sent to Beirut yesterday. 


Afif Gharib was unable to say how Fouad and the family managed to get to Beirut, only saying that the Canadian Embassy called and then the family left. 

Greenwell could not speak to the Gharibs'' situation, but did say it is possible that the embassy or the government sent for them specifically. 

"We always do our best, sometimes even against our own advice, when it comes to helping Canadians," she said. 

The Tyre ship boarded 1,000 evacuees. The Beirut ship took just around 200. That brings the total number of Canadians evacuated from Lebanon to about 10,000 since the conflict began. 

Fouad Gharib and his family were planning to stay in Lebanon until the end of August. It was a chance for three of his five children, who were born in Canada, to finally meet their grandparents. 

They were in southern Lebanon doing just that when the first attacks were launched by the Israeli Defence Force in retaliation for Hezbollah''s kidnapping and killing of Israeli soldiers. 

One of the bombs fell just 200 metres from his father''s home. Flying debris from the impact of the blast hit and injured one of Fouad''s daughters, Hoda, a Bayridge Secondary School student. 

The family immediately fled north to the Bekaa valley, where they found refuge with Fouad''s brother. 

There, they remained out of the danger zone and spent days trying to arrange an escape from the war-torn country with the Canadian Embassy in Beirut. 

When contacted by The Whig on Monday, Fouad expressed deep frustration with the embassy''s apparent unwillingness to extract his family from the Lebanese interior. Most roads leading to the Mediterranean coast had been blown out by bombs. 

"I''ve been pleading with the government to get us out of here," said Gharib. "We''re waiting for the phone to ring ... for them to tell us how to get out." 

Fouad''s brother-in-law, Hassan Akar, has been running the restaurant in Kingston during his absence. 

Akar had been trying just as hard from Kingston as Fouad was from Lebanon to get his family members out of Lebanon, registering them with foreign affairs and making daily calls to press the department for a rescue.

This is a discussion I was having over at Alan''s blog, but he has a nasty habit of deleting and rewriting comments when he''s losing an argument, so I thought I''d start the thread over here on more blog-friendly territory.<p>

<blockquote>

Re-posted from Alan''s Blog:<p>

Marian [11:19 AM January 23, 2007]
The main difference between blogging and journalism isn''t professionalism, because of course, there are many dolts in journalism (and some would say that it isn&#8217;t in fact a profession, but a trade -- I read that somewhere in the Globe and Mail), and nothing is stopping smart people, or knowledgeable people, or even journalists themselves from blogging. The main difference isn&#8217;t professionalism, it&#8217;s a relative lack of constraints. So while Mark Starowicz can say (to The Senate Transport and Communications Committee) about television programming in Canada that:<p>

&#8220;...Canadian programming is strangled daily. Not because Canadians don''t want it. Not
because we can''t compete with the world. But because it''s not the most efficient return on investment, or not the most efficient demographic targeting device to sell consumer products. Why does it have to be? How did the marketing heads of Coca Cola and Canadian Tire become the people who decide what appears on Canadian television? I understand and accept that if a Canadian program isn''t popular, has not found a significant audience, it should probably die. But I resent that a Canadian program will not even be born, even if it reaches a large audience, if I can''t prove it will sell shampoo.&#8221;- But this is clearly not true of online opportunities.<p>

It seems to me that freedom to create is not nothing. Having a big open space to play in, is not nothing. In answer to your question though: One thing that blogs do well is local coverage. Not coincidentally, local coverage is what has been increasingly dropped from news in many areas as a cost saving measure over the last few decades. Here is a site, for instance, that does local blogging: http://placeblogger.com/. On the other hand, I don&#8217;t actually concede the point that it&#8217;s up to us to prove the worth of a big open space by finding the future masterpieces in it today. Just as it wasn&#8217;t up to the founders of Canada or the US to prove the worth of their country in everyday details circa 1776/1867. The internet is a work in progress. &#8220;Hah!&#8221; I can hear those early critics proclaim, &#8220;Those colonials are all just a bunch ridiculous yobs. They&#8217;ll never amount to much, mark my words!&#8221; Right.<p>

I think it&#8217;s important to take note of the fact that this contrast between journalism and citizen journalism occurs in a particular context: When media Barons started taking over newspapers and television stations and merging companies in the 1980s and 90s to form huge media empires, they looked for a way of squeezing more money out of the business. The fastest way, it seemed, was to fire tonnes of staff and concentrate on soft news, fluff, and opinion -- leaving a huge portion of the real news to be done by freelancers and news services. Sometimes they hired a handful of genuine experts to write columns as well. But all of this cost a great deal less than actual journalism which involves real digging, fact checking, and investigative work by several paid staff over a long period of time (and that&#8217;s for each story). Thus, after many years of cuts, it became easier for any old bozo to mimic what was actually published in the papers because a lot less of it was what my father (an old time newspaperman) would call journalism. Most people can write fluff and opinion (though many can&#8217;t spell) and many don&#8217;t need experts to sort through the five or six stories that are being reprinted in all the papers of a given chain. Journalism, contrary to a recent poll of journalists, is not high art, though it can be complex and full of insight etc.. Anyway, if we want more news, the solution is not to blame all our problems on the internet. Instead, we need to change the laws governing media concentration and beef up the CBC.<p>

Alan [12:24 PM January 23, 2007]
Similarly, I can still hear those that laughed at the Parisian pneumatic tube mail system of the 1860s not to mention 1909 music by telephone and the speaker chair.  Until you can define citizen journalism with any certainty and agreement, praising its success now or in the near future is a bit weak.<p>

Marian [12:46 PM January 23, 2007]
As is running it down.<p>

Alan [1:11 PM January 23, 2007]
If applying a critical analysis with solid illustrations of similarly failed concepts is "running down" then, again, all that is being confirmed is that wobbly but widely hugged concepts like citizen journalism are most likely a fraud.<p>

Marian [1:18 PM January 23, 2007]
There needs to be some middle ground between praising things to the skies and saying it''s all crap. I am sympathetic to journalists, but I don''t think we should be totally uncritical. Likewise, I think a lot of what is on the internet is awful, but some of it isn''t. I think there is a lot of nasty chatter in the press about the internet, not because the internet is a crocheted nose bag, but because it does represent a threat. I think the threat comes from the attractiveness of some of what is out there. Now, we can all sit back and sneer at the many ninnies. Of course, that is always possible. But it proves nothing. And I''ve always thought that there is something a little sinister in trying to shut stuff down.<p>

Alan [1:22 PM January 23, 2007]
I praise not the journalist and have said I am inline to kick at processionalism. I am merely pointing out the citizen journalism is the Emperor with No Clothes 2.0.
As for "sneering" that is not anything associated with me or anyone else so it is without merit. We deal in illustrations and argument only.<p>

Marian [1:28 PM January 23, 2007]
I still don''t concede your premise that we must prove the worth of the internet *to you* using current examples. In any case, as you have pointed out, confirming your own preconceived notions is the point of your blog, so it would be an impossible task.<p>

Alan [1:33 PM January 23, 2007]
You have fallen into the trap of rudeness and have been led astray. You do not have to prove anything to me but it is not a premise, it is a courtesy - if you are going to write on the blog of another on a topic, do the other readers the favour of being on point and engaging rather than judging from high as no one really recognizes anyone else as being on high in such a case, just the sidelines. If you cannot prove your argument, check if you actually have an argument and then see if there is proof and add that, too. But you know this.</blockquote>


In my opinion Alan''s argument is along the lines of proving a negative:

Prove to me that God *does not* exist even though I am a Christian. If you cannot show me examples of God''s non-existence (and I get to judge which are true examples and which are bogus examples), then God exists.

I say the burden of proof does not lie with us. We do not need to show Alan that the internet does not suck. Alan''s saying that it does suck, does not prove that it sucks. But Alan knows that.', '2007-01-24 01:22:37', '2008-06-12 14:46:58.572124', 0, true, true, true, 'anothergreat', true);

We have one province that limits the seating capacity of brew pubs, another that deems the government owns all the beer as soon as it is put in a
container and yet another that has a law that effectively bans having a beer in the shower!   I had no idea that the privies, lavatories and
toilets of Manitoba were at such risk.<p>I asked some of Ontario smaller craft brewers about the troubles they face from the the state of the law in the land today. Joseph Tuer at Stratford Brewing Company  (www.stratfordbrewing.com) had to scratch his head at the Federal excise officials who required him to to calibrate his second-hand US bright tanks into hectolitres.  The Federal Government charges excise tax on the manufacture of beer and charges according to the measurement in these tanks.  They were not content to calibrate according to the US gallon and then make the conversion from gallons to litres on paper, the tanks themselves had to be altered.   This over-attention to the under-important cost money that could otherwise be used to spread the word about good beer or even lower the cost of a craft brewer''s best.<p>It is not all bad, however, as the recently elected national Conservative government gave the micro-brewers a huge break by slashing the rate of that excise tax.  For Steve at Beau''s All Natural Brewing Company (www.beaus.ca) the effect was huge.  "We''ve forecast sales of 1,000 hectolitres (100,000 litres) in our first year of operations. As we''re at the smallest tier, we get the full 90%
reduction - about $0.25 per litre.  That represents a savings of $25,000 if we meet our sales goals."  This 25,000 will go into promoting the new brewery to get them to the break even point sooner.<p>Sadly, as anyone who has shopped for beer south of the border is all too aware, taxes and what can only be called price fixing in Canada keep the price of beer high.  While some provinces like Saskatchewan add another 10% on beer on top of general sales taxes that can top
16%, most go further and operate the beer market as a state wholesale and retail monopoly.  The Ontario''s LCBO uses that monopoly power to require that brewers and all other suppliers give them what they call the best price.  What it means is that if a brewer strikes a deal with another buyer that is lower than the LCBO paid, the LCBO gets a refund for the difference.  This effectively kills the marketplace and any incentive a craft brewer has to haggle while trying to find his market.<p>
In the end it is not even the state of the law that can bug a brewer most.  For John at Church-Key Brewing (www.churchkeybrewing.com) the
real bother is inconsistent application.  He says "at the licensee level AGCO enforcement officers strictly enforce some rules and completely ignore others."  This sort of thing leaves brewers at best guessing how to do their job and at worst facing a rule that is not being applied to the next guy.<p>As Pete Brown wrote in his recent book Three Sheets to the Wind, "more than climate or genetics or anything else, drinking behaviour is
governed by culture.  And that culture is created by the laws that govern it."  I would suggest the same is true for brewing culture.', '2007-04-08 14:33:54', '2008-06-12 14:46:58.585216', 0, true, true, true, 'canadianbeer', true);

Also, folkswere getting established away from the Maritimes.  Mark showed in March 1996 and Colin a month later.   JR joins in June 1996 and in September 1996, Artie J.

<p>Fritz and Darren join in November 1996, Gary in December 1996.  In March 1997, there was as yet no hockey pool and not real Crows.   Colin 
MacLean triggered the first idea...

<p>About a month later the first playoof pool picks are coming in, new people are connecting on the Alnet in droves and Darren raises one of the most important topics ever discussed in a Alnet posting.   On 2 April 1997 he wrote:

<p><ul>"Re: Beer Hi Guys; How are things up North? Weather here in Cincinnati has been quite nice, couple of 70 degree days of late.

<p>What an important question...

<p>Two very interesting March and April 1997 postings were forwards from JR in which he and Darren and he and Rob are instigating their 
e-mail correspondences.  One is titled "Re: Caw, Caw" while the other is "Re: Cawww, Cawww".  Other than a post in September 1996 in which Tree described his return to schooling at UNB as follows:

<p><ul>"I am actually studying and paying attention in class and I hardly ever yell out "Stones! You''re all a bunch of crows!" Well, hardly ever."</ul>

<p>There are few references to crow-ness before 1997.  Lots about NHL, drinking, moving back to the Martimes and "whose e-mail do you have?"  In january 1997 references to Tree as Crowboy appear in "re: lines".

<p>Even the Crow Bowl does not have its own first place in history as such.  From a June 1997 posting the following is set out under the re: line "Lindsay MacIsaac Invitational Soccer match!!!"

McIsaac and perhaps one or two of the stumble fucks if someone can find out where they are.   Weekend celebrations include a steer barbeque at 
the house of whoever doesn''t read this e-mail, "glory days" afternoon at the Lower Deck Saturday and frantic bout of mini-put or bowling on Sunday night.

Gill.  It has sat on the old C:/ drive ever since.', '<em>He hates football but loves interior design, loathes Dixons but can''t resist Russell & Bromley. A A GILL on why it''s time to come out</em><p>Mum, dad, sit down please, I''ve got something I need to tell you. I suppose I''ve known for some time. The signs were there: the inappropriate pleasure at being sent cut flowers, discovering that somehow, by a process of cultural osmosis, I''d absorbed all the lyrics to Annie Get Your Gun without ever seeing it, the fact that I''d rather loiter outside Russell & Bromley than Dixons. Oh, I''ve tried to ignore it, to bury it. I''ve woken in the middle of the night damp with the inexplicable desire to watch Doris Day and rearrange the furniture. But, you know, I always put it down to the natural doubts that all men suffer (except Les Dawson, of course). <p>I''ve tried to pretend that silk next to my skin, eau de cologne and two starters was just a phase. And I''d grow out of kissing men friends, and deliberately watching films that make me cry. That I''d naturally grow into burping on demand, They Think It''s All Over, jokes with punch lines
that involve spitting and movies with more open wounds than smooches. That I''d progress from Hardy Amies to Martin Amis. But it''s no good, I can''t help it. Sorry, am I waving my arms around? I''m 44 and I can''t go on denying my true nature. I can''t go on wasting my life pretending to be heterosexual. <p> Mum, dad, I''m gay and I''m proud. Proud and free, free to clap my hands at window displays. Free to laugh with a little shriek. Free to ask strangers where their delicious scent came from. But there''s a problem - sorry, another problem. I don''t want to have sex with men. I really, really don''t want to have sex with men. I''ve tried to force myself to think about it till I''m limp. The truth is, I only really like doing it with girls. Always have, always will. The one hard and fast rule of my sex life is only one willy in the bed at a time. <p>
So you see, this leaves me in something of a dilemma.  According to society''s rather rigid definitions, I''m caught betwixt and between. I''m neither one thing nor the other. We define "gay" purely in sexual terms. According to the law and charities and pressure groups and Peter Tatchell,
homosexuality is an act.<p>You never talk about celibate homosexuals as you might talk about celibate heterosexuals. Yet all this is patently
nonsense, only half a truth. We can all tell a gay man at 100 paces. You don''t have to catch them at it. Gay is a way of thinking, of being. It''s a raised eyebrow. A scatter of cushions. A table setting. It''s musical theatre and a
bathroom cabinet that''s always too damn small. <p>
I''ve come out because I think there are a lot more men like me still in. Sort of tweed poofs. A few weeks ago Chris Evans came out on Virgin Radio and pronounced he was "going to be queer for a year", and the columnist Richard
Littlejohn came out in The Sun, although this was less of a surprise - that sweaty butch act wasn''t fooling anyone, Richard. Attitude, a gay magazine, outed me as born gay but trapped in a heterosexual body, and bells rang. On top
of all that, there have been other little things. Liam Neeson playing Oscar Wilde, and a Spectator lunch I was at. Down my end of the table a knot of girlies discussed the modern political biography while, up the butch men''s end, Bruce Anderson, Frank Johnson and Lord Owen animatedly questioned my style-editor girlfriend on cranial
osteopathy and moisturisers. Hello, I thought. Hell-o. <p>Last weekend, flicking through the channels with my children, my five-year-old son (who was threading beads for a necklace) shouted: "Stop there, daddy." It was Funny
Girl. Barbra cooed down the generations. It was man talk.  My daughter, who was playing on the computer, pulled a face and said: "Who''s that ugly screechy woman?" She just didn''t get it. <p>
I think women have a lot to do with all us heterogays. Women''s liberation has unquestionably been the best thing that''s happened to my generation of chaps. They struggled and sweated to be Margaret Thatcher, Edwina Curry, Betty Boothroyd and Anita Roddick and then bellowed:
"You see, we''re as good at it as men are." And a lot of us men just thought, thank God, now I don''t have to be Mo Mowlam and Madeleine Albright. I can go to Peter Jones instead. You see, modern women make much better men than men ever did. The truth is that for most of us, our
hearts were never in it - being blokey. We were living a lie.<p>I admit this is a bit rough on women who thought they were going to be let into an exclusive club of power and privilege, but have just found out that they''ve been turned
into fag hags who have to do the paperwork as well. <p>If you doubt there''s a swelling chorus line of us heterogays, just look at the rise of men''s magazines. They''re not all read by boys who want to be Jeremy Clarkson, you know. Lots of them want to be Ute Lemper. Men''s fashion and
toiletries are markets that are growing faster than they can find heterogay shop assistants to staff them. Walk down any high street on a Saturday or into any new Brit restaurant and you''ll see the legion of straightish friends of
Dorothy weighed down with carrier bags. If you''re a chap who''s still reading this and thinking, come on, get real, we know, suck in your cheeks, not your beer gut. It''s okay, trust me. If you still have doubts, here''s a little quiz. <p>
<blockquote>1. Whose autograph would you rather queue in the rain for: Liza Minnelli''s or Jim Davidson''s?<br><p>
2. You are all alone in your room, the curtains are drawn, and Gloria Gaynor singing I Will Survive comes on the radio. Do you start dancing in front of the mirror or do you get on with making a plastic model of a nuclear submarine,
and wonder why Chris Evans never plays Metallica. <br><p>3.

From Crow Bowl II to Road Hockey I</b><p>After Crow Bowl II, things got rolling.  Perhaps from a soccer point of view there was no greater point of achievement than the game against the Kings Varsity team in late September 1998.   We tied them 2-2.   I did not get any photos from this game as it was a pretty hard affair with Rob Douglas, then coach of Kings Varsity having to red card at least one player on his side for rough play.  I think Gary got both goals and have a distinct recollection of him bouncing one of them in on a header off one of my crosses.  UKC Varsity went on to the National College Championships that year representing Atlantic Canada.<p>Later, at the Winter meetings of Crow Inc. held on 1 January 1999 at the Lion''s Head, after the inaugural Winter Bowl Road Hockey game, matters were discussed with those present [using the semi-autonomous benevolent oligarchical determination system upon the Tashkent model which had served us so well in the past.]  The Winter Bowl road hockey game was a huge success with ten guys out on a very cold New Year''s Day in the North End at Highland Park School off of Lady Hammond. Participants included Ken and Dave Swick, brothers to Rob of the King''s soccer team; Crane (after a late call and a furious drive over from Eastern Passage); "Dandy" Dan Davis; Darren Clelland; Steve Maher; yours truly; JR; Rob Douglas; and Mike Collins. Others absent included some later realized I had forgot to call such as Keith McPhail and Neil Robertson - mea culpa. I also failed to properly get in touch with Ian Folkins - leaving only a voice mail - who had e-mailed me saying he wanted to play. Ales were had at the site after as well as at the Lion''s Head. The other team won 5-1 but only because we were working on a first to five system after lots of hacking around and the agreement that we would be getting out of a pretty cold New Years Day and into some more ales after those brought were consumed in the parking lot.<p><b>2.

Got it?</blockquote>JR said different.<blockquote>Manderville wrote:<p>

Now if I could only remember which foot I kick with . . .<p>Freakin'' Fritzy </blockquote>Apparently someone at Kings alumni heard about what was going on and asked for an exmplanation:<blockquote>
You have asked why it is called the Crow Bowl...<p>A group of Kings soccer team players from the early 80''s lingered on in Halifax through the second half of the decade and into the 90''s doing other degrees, working in part time jobs and drifting in and out of town before or after working over seas.    Shiftless Generation X personified.   In 1987, after playing softball every sunday afternoon in 1986, we found a half size playground and started playing soccer every Sunday starting at 1:00 pm until we dropped.  Sometimes we played up to four hours.  Half-time was dubbed "smoke break."   We often were suffering from the effects of another
Saturday night at the Seahorse.<p>Over the years, different people shifted in and out of the game but the core group was Kings alumni.    In around 1993 the game became harder to play regularly as many people had left the area getting on with their lives, working from Japan to the Arctic to Slovakia. In the mid-90''s, enough of the players and other friends had acquired e-mail that we started what was first dubbed the Al-net (after me) and then the Crow-net.   We hunted out e-mails
of other Kings friends and now have at least 25 on the list and expect about twice that number share the messages.<p>Al-net was the first name for the group as it followed the attempt to have a
''zine called "People Who Know Al," a photocopied mail out published in Pembroke Ontatio and patterned after the "Ancient Commoner" at Kings, an unofficial newletter at the University rumoured to be edited by Marcus Snowden with contributions mainly from the frosh classes of 1980-82 but also a certain former pres. and now member of Parliament.  The "Ancient Commoner"
was anonymous and associated also with other anonymous events such as raids on the Kings kitchen, the fridge/flight project and the YASL - the young anarcho-socialist league and its move to plant cabbages in the quad.    I still have a few copies stored away of both the newsletters.

Anyway, I was looking for another name as I wanted the passing of information and the continuation of friendships in a broader sense.   At the same time, a number of us who lived outside the Maritimes arranged our 1997 
summer holidays at the same time to play a Sunday game.    About 21 came out, played first at the old small field then got booted off by a under-8
girls team.   Undaunted we moved to a field in the North end and continued. After the Douglas boys proved they could score lots of goals on bad goalies, we stopped, retired to the Lion''s Head Pub and then to JR Manderville''s for a BBQ where the actual trophy, the Coupe de Corbiere was first presented. A video tape was made by the Marion MacIsaac so that Gary''s and her daughter
then living in BC could know which crow was which.   Whites beat darks that first year.   In 1998, Crow Bowl II was held on the Commons in Halifax with the addition of actual jerseys and another player.   Blue beat green. We called it the "Crow Bowl" after one of the common epithets floating around Kings in the early 80''s usually out of the mouth of one Arther "Tree" Matheson, VP external of the Student Union (ret.).   Usage was usually in the form of "you crow!" or "you are all just a bunch of crows!" often aimed
at the campus police at 1:00 am or so.   Though it is hotly debated, the term was brought to Kings by Mark Renouf, now a radio Producer with BBC News in London, who had a teacher from the UK in the late 1970''s who, frustrated with the intellectual capacity of the students at the High School in Trenton, Pictou Co. would loudly retort - "you are just a pack of idle crows."<p>
The Crow Bowl celebrates the spirit of the idle crow.   This year will be Crow Bowl III.   Every year we - a pack of unbrilliant players- have a game of soccer without style, relive past youth and retire to the Grad House at Dal for any number of real ales.  We have found that those who were idle crows are now moving up their careers as medical and legal practitioners,
journalists, educators and government administrators.  No religious types yet though we are negotiating with the agent for the Weston boys of the late 1970''s.  All are welcome to watch the game and, if a former Crow, play.
The qualifications are very lax.   The core group of King''s alumni also played the Kings varity squad last year and tied the league champions.   We will likely play again this year.    We like to say - "we may not be great but we do not suck."  We also keep in touch via e-mail, Jamie Phillips in Japan being the farthest.  We do not yet know if old King crow "Tree" will make an appearance.<p>We also now have the game on a Saturday so the effects of the morning after
the night before are not suffered until the morning after the game.<p>For more info, ask Neil.   Ask also about the wine and cheese club or cheap hotels.<p>Game to be played at St. Francis field in Halifax at 1:00-ish on Saturday,

Dear Alan,<p>
As I mentioned before, it has been great fun experiencing the build-up to
CBIII, albeit from a great distance, and by e-mail.<p>Anyway thanks for the invitation to greet the crows. I did manage to  look
at some old photos from the 1982 - 1989 Halifax era. We had some good fun
didn''t we?! The photos of you, me, Jon, Gary, and Rendick ''lubing up'' and
then doing Charles Atlas poses on Jon''s deck prior to the Croquet match are
truly priceless.<p>The crow tradition as far as I remember it, can certainly be traced back to
the man in the Sifto hat, as well as some other legendary sayings like: "If
we weren''t losing we''d be winning". That one might come in handy on
Saturday.<p>I''m sorry I haven''t had the time to do anything about sending greetings to
you all, however I will say this:<p>Do not let it be said on Saturday to any crow, if found in the prone position bowking his/her guts out, the unforgettable words said to me, one
afternoon at the bottom of Citadel Hill after one of those infamous runs
(including the stairs), by our beloved Geordie coach: Alec Feargrieve...
"Ah...lad, I''ve been there before lad..."<p>Anyway, it would have been nice to be there - maybe next year, who knows.
God bless you guys... Please send photos (jpeg or gifs please), and keep the e-mail contact.<p>Jamie.<p>PS A special big hello to Fish, JR, Gary, Tubs, Rob, and of course Tree if
he shows.</blockquote><p><b>3.  The Poem</b><p><img src="local/genx40/images/CBIIIRD.jpg" class="center" alt="More Crow-etry"><p><b>4.  The Report</b><p>From: Abby, Ellen and Alan <br>Sent: Sunday, July 25, 1999 10:51 PM<br>

Once again this year a world wide audience said a find farewell for
another year to the festivities surrounding the Crowl Bowl.  Apart from
the apparent malfunction of the individual pace monitor set on Kevin
Crain which led to the sprightly Alan McLeod winning "the most
economical pace of the game," the game was played with out much
controversy.<p>The gods took pity on Gary MacIsaac and Rob Douglas and finally allowed
them to sip victory from the Crow Bowl, an honour which was deferred after JR had a good look inside - "beware...white metal...beer will
dissolve it."   Green beat Blue a reverse of last year''s Blue victory over Green.    After the initial monochromatic White over dark in CB I,
there is a hot debate among the statisticians over what the heck it all means.   Final score was 4-2 or 5-2 depending on who cares.<p>After the game, the fans and players retired first (and maybe for the last time) to the Lions Head for a bit of discussion of the NS election
a beer or two and a surprise performance art presentation by the food
waitress entitled "I work for tips?!?!?"    The evening concluded in the
cavernous yet ill-air-conditioned Grad House where last call was an
obligation rather than a pleasure so as to ensure there was a tab at the
end of the night large enough to justify opening the place.<p>Science notes that apparently during the winter of 1998-99, 71% of the
Crow Bowl participants aged 53.7% as ass dragging was the most obvious
skill on display.  The Blue team two-man striker duo, knicknamed the
"cherry picker line" of McLeod and Dave Swick, offered the team a
collective 78 years experience on the planet which accounted for one
goal and, strangely, no opportunities.  Next year they look forward to
entering their nineth collective decade together on the pitch.   [Oddly,
I can think of nothing to which occured elsewhere on the field - can
anyone illuminate me on events oher than in the opposing field right
third of the half...its like I was not anywhere else at all...]<p>Thanks to all who helped set up CB III and those who came.   Special
thanks to Darren, Heather, Rob and Dan for putting the game and
afterwards matters together [- who have I forgotten?]   I will be
putting together a portfolio of photos once the film is back from the
processor and hope to have offerings of team photos from the first three
years.  Please look around and see if you have photos worth reprinting and sharing.<p>Crow Bowl III marks the beginning of the third year of operations of

Interesting notes of Crow Bowl IV:<p>
I don''t think we''ve ever had pictures of JR''s ass being spanked by a pool cue.  Sure it''s probably happened before, but never caught on film.
Whomever took them, for God''s sake warn the person developing them.<p>
Although, not many were at the Grad House (as were expected), we cetainly reached the limit (I believe we ended at about $550).  The bartender was amazed at the amount of tips he received.<p>
I never quite realized how well Smedley could sing until I heard his rendition of Werewolves of London.  A shame most people had left at this
point (or was that why they left).<p>
How Kevin Crain, Greg MacDonald, and JR Manderville, were not scooped up by Atlantic Grand Prix Wrestling, just escapes me.  I suppose Gary MacIsaac should be included as well.  Even though he wasn''t "wrasslin''" while in the Grad House, he did put on a display as he and JR were walking home.  Had it not been for Greg pointing out through the window from the Grad House, we
may never have seen him smashing JR''s head into a tree.<p>
How sore I can really get after doing so little running.  And for how long the soreness will last.  I had to rest halfway through this note before I could continue.<p>

Indeed, such a view would run contrary to the basic idea, expressed both at the outset of these reasons and in my reasons in B.

Moreover, I do not even consider that the sphere of autonomy includes within its scope every matter that might, however vaguely, be described as "private". Rather, as I see it, the autonomy protected by the s. 7 right to liberty encompasses only those matters that can properly be characterized as fundamentally or inherently personal such that, by their very nature, they implicate basic choices going to the core of what it means to enjoy individual dignity and independence. As I have already explained, I took the view in B. (R.) that parental decisions respecting the medical care provided to their children fall within this narrow class of inherently personal matters.

The liberty interest protected by s. 7 of the Charter is no longer restricted to mere freedom from physical restraint. Members of this Court have found that "liberty" is engaged where state compulsions or prohibitions affect important and fundamental life choices. This applies for example where persons are compelled to appear at a particular time and place for fingerprinting (Beare, supra); to produce documents or testify (Thomson Newspapers Ltd. v. Canada (Director of Investigation and Research, Restrictive Trade Practices Commission), [1990] 1 S.C.R. 425); and not to loiter in particular areas (R. v. Heywood, [1994] 3 S.C.R. 761). In our free and democratic society, individuals are entitled to make decisions of fundamental importance free from state interference. In B. (R.) v. Children''s Aid Society of Metropolitan Toronto, [1995] 1 S.C.R. 315, at para. 80, La Forest J., with whom L''Heureux-Dub&eacute;, Gonthier and McLachlin JJ. agreed, emphasized that the liberty interest protected by s. 7 must be interpreted broadly and in accordance with the principles and values underlying the Charter as a whole and that it protects an individual''s personal autonomy:
<blockquote>. . . liberty does not mean mere freedom from physical restraint. In a free and democratic society, the individual must be left room for personal autonomy to live his or her own life and to make decisions that are of fundamental personal importance.</blockquote>
50.     In R. v. Morgentaler, [1988] 1 S.C.R. 30, Wilson J., speaking for herself alone, was of the opinion that s. 251 of the Criminal Code violated not only a woman''s right to security of the person but her s. 7 liberty interest as well. She indicated that the liberty interest is rooted in fundamental notions of human dignity, personal autonomy, privacy and choice in decisions regarding an individual''s fundamental being. She conveyed this as follows, at p. 166:
<blockquote>Thus, an aspect of the respect for human dignity on which the Charter is founded is the right to make fundamental personal decisions without interference from the state. This right is a critical component of the right to liberty. Liberty, as was noted in Singh, is a phrase capable of a broad range of meaning. In my view, this right, properly construed, grants the individual a degree of autonomy in making decisions of fundamental personal importance.</blockquote>
The above passage was endorsed by La Forest J. in B. (R.), supra, at para. 80. This Court in B. (R.) was asked to decide whether the s. 7 liberty interest protects the rights of parents to choose medical treatment for their children. The above passage from Wilson J. was applied by La Forest J. to individual interests of fundamental importance in our society such as the parental interest in caring for one''s children.<p>
51.     In Godbout v. Longueuil (City), [1997] 3 S.C.R. 844, at para. 66, La Forest J., writing for L''Heureux-Dub&eacute; J. and McLachlin J. (as she then was), reiterated his position that the right to liberty in s. 7 protects the individual''s right to make inherently private choices and that choosing where to establish one''s home is one such inherently personal choice:

<blockquote>The foregoing discussion serves simply to reiterate my general view that the right to liberty enshrined in s. 7 of the Charter protects within its ambit the right to an irreducible sphere of personal autonomy wherein individuals may make inherently private choices free from state interference. I must emphasize here that, as the tenor of my comments in B. (R.) should indicate, I do not by any means regard this sphere of autonomy as being so wide as to encompass any and all decisions that individuals might make in conducting their affairs.

As I have already explained, I took the view in B. (R.) that parental decisions respecting the medical care provided to their children fall within this narrow class of inherently personal matters.  In my view, choosing where to establish one''s home is, likewise, a quintessentially private decision going to the very heart of personal or individual autonomy.</blockquote>

La Forest J. therefore spoke in Godbout of a narrow sphere of inherently personal decision-making deserving of the law''s protection. Choosing where to establish one''s home fell within that narrow class according to three members of this Court.<p>
52.     Dissenting at the New Brunswick Court of Appeal in G. (J.), I also favoured a more generous approach to the liberty interest that would protect personal rights that are inherent to the individual and consistent with the essential values of our society (New Brunswick (Minister of Health and Community Services) v. J.G. (1997), 187 N.B.R. (2d) 81, at para. 49). In this vein, the parental interest in raising and caring for one''s children would be protected. I however agreed with La Forest J.''s caution that the liberty interest would encompass only those decisions that are of fundamental importance.<p>
53.     Professor Hogg, supra, at p. 44-9, supports a more cautious approach to the interpretation of s. 7 such that s. 7 does not become a residual right which envelopes all of the legal rights in the Charter. Professor Hogg also addresses the deliberate omission of "property" from "life, liberty and security of the person" in s. 7, and states, at p. 44-12:
<blockquote>It also requires . . . that those terms [liberty and security of the person] be interpreted as excluding economic liberty and economic security; otherwise, property, having been shut out of the front door, would enter by the back.</blockquote>
54.     Although an individual has the right to make fundamental personal choices free from state interference, such personal autonomy is not synonymous with unconstrained freedom. In the circumstances of this case, the state has not prevented the respondent from making any "fundamental personal choices". The interests sought to be protected in this case do not in my opinion fall within the "liberty" interest protected by s. 7.</div>', '2003-06-19 04:37:16', '2008-06-12 14:46:57.37346', 30, true, true, true, 'blencoevbritish', true);

<p>The silverorange labs are a place where we at <a href="http://www.silverorange.com">silverorange</a> share some of our ideas with others and where we look for feedback on issues from other developers.</p>

<p>It is here that we will set aside the marketing mask and open up as much as possible the technologies, people, and ideas that have made silverorange into what it is today. We''ll be looking for feedback on technical issues, sharing solutions we''ve created, discussing business models, and sharing our thoughts on the web development industry. We encourage you to participate with lively and honest debate.</p>

<p>The labs also function as a place to showcase some of our own personal projects we''ve developed aside from projects we develop for <a href="http://www.silverorange.com/a/portfolio">our clients</a>.  As well, we realized that we''ve developed lots of little standalone applications, functions, and features which we could share with the other developers everywhere as open source.  Part of this move was out of benevolence, but it''s also partly out of our own self interest.  If you implement one of these things, we''d like to receive your feedback, comments, and most importantly your improvements to them.</p>

The discussion should touch on stuff useful for any agreement but I will use information technology as the context where context is useful.  The classic disclaimer applies.  This will not be written as legal advice for you or is to be taken as legal advice for you.  Hopefully it will be a primer on the principles, the elements of a contract, which will be of use to a few people I know and others like them needing a bit of a heads up on the general vocabulary before a piece of paper is pushed across a table to the tune of that old song "please sign here".<p>If you have any questions or comments, please post them <a href="http://www.genx40.com/archives/2003/june/handupproject">here</a>.<p>For other reading on contracts and IT, please check out these other sites:<ul><li>The Government of Canada''s <a href="http://strategis.ic.gc.ca/epic/internet/inoca-bc.nsf/vwGeneratedInterE/ca01036e.html">blurb on the basics of e-commerce contracting</a>.</div>', '', '2003-07-03 05:24:35', '2008-06-12 14:46:57.407513', 20, true, true, true, 'itcontracting', true);

It is that simple.  When you make a deal with some entity that is not you you are making a contract.</div>', '<div style="text-align: justify;">The word contract sounds rather official.  Rock bands have made it when they have a contract.  New consultants celebrate their first contract and hang on to them as the strting point of their careers.   The word, however, is much less special than most think as contracts are everywhere.<p>Deal, handshake, agreement, bargain, purchase, memorandum of understanding, guarantee, ticket, licence, lease, marriage, employment, transaction are all types of contracts.  Some lack key aspects that make us consider them contracts.  Memorandums of understanding are not enforceable due to a statement set out within them that the parties agree not to be subject to enforcement measures if they fail to honour the intent.  Marriages are still contracts but enforcement of many of the terms of marriage have been barred by law: bringing a court action for breach of the promise to marry, for example, was barred in most Canadian provinces in the first part of the 1900''s.  They are still contracts in so far as they go.<p>Some things similar to contracts are not contracts - etiquette, a simple gift or a promise.   The unilateral nature of these relationships make them insufficient to trigger the binding aspect of contract.  There may be cultural, social or moral reasons which make these relationships binding but this does not make them a contract.   Other things like statutory obligation are binding but are not contracts because they are imposed by the state.<p>This is the critical point: the parties define the rules of the deal.  Sometimes this is called private law.  It is not private in the sense that it is usually enforcable only by the courts - though private commercial courts and arbitrators do exist.  It is private in that the content of the deal is almost exclusively up to the parties.  The public court and the legislature will intervene where the deal is unconscionable or illegal.   Otherwise, it is up to the parties to define how they will be bound.<p>So what is a contract?   A relationship of exchange between two or more which legally binds based on rules largely set by the two.</div>', '2003-07-03 05:26:28', '2008-06-12 14:46:57.41169', 10, true, true, true, 'whatsacontract', true);

Figuring our exactly who is involved in a contract is one of the most important questions.</div>', '<div style="text-align: justify;">In this section, I look at:<ul><li>The classes of legal entity</li><li>Humans</li><li>Non-human contracting parties.</li></ul>There are a number of classes of entity out there, some of which can contract and some of which cannot.  Parties can be single humans, partnerships of humans, non-human corporations, non-corporate governments and non-human trusts.  Also, each can operate under their own name or a business name.  Each class of entity has its advantages and disadvantages.  For purposes of this section, it is just important to distinguish between them.<p>Individual humans can for the most part enter deals by their natural civil rights.   Some classes of humans cannot contract.  People who are too young or too mental infirm are excused from much deal making.   These classes are about who can contract.  It is different from the question of should you contract with them.  Some persons are unwise to contract with as they lack the required wealth or other forms of security.   Some persons are unwise to deal with as they have a bad track record as can be discovered through a search of court orders and a credit listing.  Know which human you are dealing with.<p>Humans can gather together, for a contract amongs themselves and present themselves as an entity called a partnership.  There are terms in the agreement which may be important to know if you are dealing with them - they may or may not tell you these terms.  Partnerships, for example, may only do business for a restricted purpose and your deal may not be within the sciope of their activities.  Partnerships are now usually limited to professionals.  Even they are moving towards the corporation as that form of entity limts personal liability of the participants.<p>It may appear that you are dealing with a business organization which is actually on investigation a human.  Each province has a <i>Business Names Act</i> business name registry where Fred signs up for the right to operate as <i>Freddy''s Fine Fresh Fish</i>.  If Fred has not registered he should not be operating under that name as it confuses identity.  Corporations can also register business names so XYZ Co. can operate as <i>ABC Flowershops</i>, <i>DEF Wholesale Flowers</i> and <i>GHI Flowergrowing</i> - three businesses, one corporate owner.<p>The corporation is a fiction of law.  It exists under a statute so that people can do business without personal risk to their own property if the business goes wrong.   Corporations have shareholders who own them, directors who lead them, managers who run them and employees who do the work.  In the smallest of corporation these people may all be the one person.   The corporations, however, lives a life of its own.  If the shares are sold to another, the people other involved may stay the same but the ultimate owners are completely new.<p>Governments, like municipalities, may be corporations operating under their own set of rules or they may be sovereign entities like the Canadian provinces and Federal Government, ultimately answerable to know one but the court and the voter, each in certain circumstances.   All government levels have particular rules for contracting, unique to each government body, which rules must be understood if you are to enter into bargains with them.  Get ready to read up if you want to sell to the government.<p>Trusts are a separate form of entity which are neither human or corporate and which have an ancoent history, older than corporations and even older than the right for most humans to contract as we understand that right today.   Trusts are created when a person either human or corporate, called the settlor of the trust, places property on the hands of another, called the trustee, for the benefit of a third person, the beneficiary.   The trusteee can only do what the settlor has instructed him or her to do and the trustee must also abide by the local Trustees Act.  The most common form is the estate of some who has passed away.  It is run by the executor who can contract for the sale of items for cash to go into the estate for distribution to the deceased''s family.   Trusts can also be charities and have a continuing purpose.<p>To the average schmoe IT vendor, what is important in all this is when a guy calls to buy your widget, know whether that person is speaking for himself, his partners, the government he represents, the corporation he owns, the corporation he does not own but works for, or the trust he is running...  <i>and</i> does he have authority to do what he is proposing to do.  There is nothing more irritating to get down the road on a deal to find out the other side does not have the right to do what is proposed or that the real decision maker is not at the table with you.  Especially irritating when you have started or even finished the job.  There are protections in such circumstances provided by law, but the best protection is prevention...just like Grade 9 health class taught you.</div>', '2003-07-03 05:27:13', '2008-06-12 14:46:57.416301', 20, true, true, true, 'whoarethe', true);

<b>3.  THE POEM</b><p>
Every crow down in Crowville liked Crowbowl a lot......<br>
But the Old Man, who lived west of Crowville, Did NOT!!<p>

The Old Man hated Crowbowl!  The whole Crowbowl season!<br>
Now, please don''t ask why. No one quite knows the reason.<br>
It could be his member wasn''t screwed on just right.<br>
It could be, perhaps, that his cardigan was too tight.<br>
But the most likely reason that he was avexed,<br>
Was these crows were all having premarital sex.<p>

But, whatever the reason for hating his foes<br>
He stood there on Crowbowl Eve, despising the Crows.<br>
Staring down from his cave with an Old Manly frown<br>
at the warm lighted windows below in their town.<br>
For e&#8217;ery Crow down in Crowville, he gathered or guessed<br>
was busy now, suckling, and fondling a breast.<p>

"And they''re washing their stockings!"
he snarled with a sneer,<br>
"Tomorrow is Crowbowl! It''s practically here!"<br>
Then he growled, with his digits nervously drumming,<br>
"I MUST find some way to stop Crowbowl (and Smedley) from coming!"<p>

For, Tomorrow, he knew...<br>
...All those Crow males<br>
Would wake bright and early.  They&#8217;d rush for their ales!<br>
And then! Oh, the Noise! Oh, the Noise! Noise! Noise!<br>
That''s one thing he hated!  The NOISE! NOISE! NOISE! NOISE!<p>

Then the Crows, young and old, would sit down to a feast.<br>
And they''d drink! And they''d feast!  And they''d FEAST! DRINK! FEAST!<br>
They would feast on warm Wildcat (from the finest of yeasts),<br>
Which was something the Old Man couldn''t stand in the least!<p>

And THEN<br>
They''d do something he liked least of all!<br>
Every Crow down in Crowville the tall and the small,<br>
Would stand close together, which was so un-amusing:<br>
They''d stand hand-in-hand. And the Crows would start bugling!<p>

They''d bugle! And they''d belch! And they''d DRINK! DRINK! DRINK! DRINK!<br>
And the more the Old Man pondered, whilst scratching his dink,<br>
The more the Old Man thought, "I must stop this whole thing!"<br>
"Why, for six wretched years I''ve put up with it now!"<br>
"I MUST stop this Crowbowl from coming!<br>
...But HOW?"<p>

Then he got an idea! An awful idea!<br>
THE OLD MAN GOT A WONDERFUL, AWFUL IDEA!<p>

"I know just what to do!" The Old Man laughed in his throat.<br>
And a chill then encompassed the depth of his scrote.<br>
And he chuckled, "I know how to defeat Rob and Smedley:<br>
With this coat and this hat, I look just like Saint Headley!"<p>

"All I need is a reindeer..." The Old Man looked around.<br>
But, since reindeer are scarce, there was none to be found.<br>
Since his heart was an icicle, his soul an abyss,<br>
He fashioned a harness for the Kitty of Dis.<p>

Then he loaded some bags (''twas a man without pity):<br>
To a ramshackle sleigh, did he fasten the kitty.<br>
Then the Old Man said, "Giddap!"<br>
And the sleigh started down<br>
toward the homes where the<br>
Crows lay a-snooze in their town.<p>

All their windows were dark. The Crows fast asleep,<br>
Midst brassieres and panties, all piled in a heap.<br>
Then he slid down the chimney (a sight most unangellic!)<br>
But, if Calvin could do it, then so could Old Relic.<br>
He got stuck only once, for a moment or two.<br>
Then he stuck his head out of the fireplace flue,<br>
Where the Moosehead and Garrison all stood, cooled and chilled,<br>
"I&#8217;ll take these," he snickered, "and all things distilled!"<p>

Then he slithered and slunk, (this was quite no mere rookie!)<br>
And he paused just an instant for a Maple Leaf Cookie.<br>
Oland&#8217;s! Keith&#8217;s! Labatt&#8217;s! Clancy&#8217;s!<br>
I&#8217;ll empty the bottles that these mortals do fancy!<br>
And he stuffed them in bags! (But he grimaced and grumbled,<br>
When his toe clipped the bike, o&#8217;er which Steve once had stumbled.)<p>

Then he stuffed up the chimney the ales and the beer.<br>
"And NOW!" grinned the Old Man, "I&#8216;ll relinquish their gear!"<br>
And the Old Man grabbed shin guards! and jerseys! and cleats!<br>
Had the Crows only known! (They were dreaming of teats!)<br>
In their fridge he left nothing! No Alpine! No gin!<br>
Save an empty container, where some fish sticks had been.<p>

It was quarter past dawn... All the Crows, still in bed,<br>
all the Crows still a-snooze when he packed up his sled,<br>
packed it up with their Schooner! Their head bands! Their jocks!<br>
This Relic: his heart was like igneous rock!<p>

The Old Man took the goods and was safe, so he figured<br>
When he heard the stumblings of someone quite liquored.<br>
He turned around fast, and feared for his plight<br>
Little Smedley just mumbled, &#8220;You look lovely tonight.&#8221;<p>

The ancient one had been caught while stealing the loot<br>
He was so upset with himself he almost yelled &#8220;Sploot&#8221;.<br>
Wearing only his undies, Smedley searched for a snack,<br>
He bent low in the fridge revealing his crack.<br>
Seeing all the food gone he started to cry,<br>
And he looked up at him and blubbered &#8220;Why, Old Man, Why?&#8221;<p>

But you know old Relic, he was smart and so slick<br>
So he thought up a lie and he thought it up quick<br>
&#8220;Why my sweet little Ogler,&#8221; the Relic he lied,<br>
&#8220;I brought you a Donair, but there&#8217;s no sauce inside.<br>
&#8220;So I&#8217;m taking it back to the King of Donair,<br>
&#8220;And I&#8217;ll pick up some pizza while I am there.&#8221;<p>

And his fib fooled poor Smedley, and he patted his arse,<br>
He smiled with delight at the thought of the farce.<br>
&#8220;Why that was so easy,&#8221; he pondered recalling the ruse,<br>
&#8220;If I can fool him, than pity poor Bruce.&#8221;<br>
Then he sent him to bed with some beer in his cup,<br>
And quicker than Geoff, he ate the thing up<p>

Then the last thing he took<br>
Were the smokes from poor Wank<br>
&#8220;If he&#8217;s spent all his money,&#8221; thought the ancient old crank.<br>
&#8220;He&#8217;ll be to hungover to walk to the bank.&#8221;<p>

He left one cigarette<br>
Stubbed out on the floor,<br>
Too small to smoke no matter how poor<p>

He did it to everyone<br>
A bit of a showman<br>
Leaving smokes much too small<br>
For even poor Roman<p>

It was quarter past dawn?<br>
The Lads still a-snooze<br>
Their breath was quite hazy<br>
And reeking of booze<br>
When he packed up his sled, he didn&#8217;t let up<br>
Packed it up with their gear!  But worst of all the CUP!<p>

Now to get rid of it he rode to the Palace<br>
His tiny heart filled with nothing but malice.<br>
&#8220;Woe-woe to the Crows!&#8221; he was coot-ish-ly humming!<br>
&#8220;They&#8217;re just finding out that no Crowbowl is coming!<br>
&#8220;They''re staggering out!  They&#8217;ll just have a fit!<br>
&#8220;Their gear will be gone and they&#8217;ll all have to quit<br>
&#8220;Then all the Crows down in Crowville will all yell HEL-MET!&#8221;<p>

&#8220;That is a cry,&#8221; grinned ancient old Relic,
&#8220;I couldn&#8217;t hear sooner!"<br>
So he paused.  And he drank down the last of the Schooner.<br>
As he emptied the bottle and had one of the smokes<br>
He heard something below, and he uttered a croak.<p>

For the sound wasn&#8217;t sad?<br>
They were all dancing jigs!<br>
It couldn&#8217;t be so!<br>
They&#8217;d gone to MacPigs!<p>

Every Crow down in Crowville, the clean and the smelling,<br>
Were cheering and laughing!  And whooping and yelling!<br>
He HADN&#8217;T stopped the Crowbowl from coming!<br>
No Hassle!<br>
J.R. and Gary just started to wrassle.<p>

And the Old Man, with his cardigan wrapped tightly around<br>
A wizened old body that was quite far from sound.<br>
Thought to himself how could they cheer up?<br>
Why even Big Al couldn&#8217;t have brewed some beer up!<br>
The old man realized a lesson worth learnin&#8217;<br>
His anger was due to having no sex on Vernon.<br>
&#8220;Maybe Crowbowl,&#8221; he thought, &#8220;doesn&#8217;t need all those ales.<br>
&#8220;Maybe Crowbowl?perhaps?is the telling of tales!&#8221;<p>

And what happened then??<br>
Well?in Crowville they say<br>
That after putting the<br>
Maple leaf cookies away<br>
That he found a woman dressed in a sari<br>
And he somehow convinced this woman to marry.<br>
So he joined all the Crows for he now did believe!<br>
And he?<p>

?He uncle Artie?<br>
muttered <br>
&#8220;Please Leave!&#8221;</p></div>', '2003-07-23 04:30:31', '2008-06-12 14:46:57.452143', 100, true, true, true, 'crowbowlvii', true);

All right ya bunch of bastards,<p>
First of, some will be getting this email twice since I''ve sent it 
to the IdleCrows group, but too bad. Now that Canada Day is over, all 
thoughts turn to overweight, long-past their prime, pasty-white losers, 
namely us. The Crow Bowl is scheduled for July 13th, at St. Francis 
field for 2:00 pm. We also have the Grad House booked for 5:00 pm that 
same day and they will be supplying us with barbeques and propane. Now 
for some questions:<p>
Who is going? Please let me know ASAP (really soon!) if you can or 
can''t make it. Should we have a bunch of edible meat there, or do people want to bring 
their own? Do we want a CD made and if so get you suggestions for music in QUICK.
Any other suggestions?<p>
So there you go. Please let me know who is going, tell everyone you can 
think of, and please feel free (and encouraged) to invite others outside 
the King''s gene pool.<p>
PS Smedley has promised free prostate exams to the winning team.<p>

<b>3. Report posted by Alan, 15 July 200</b>2<p>

It was with some fear that the game was begun as we had no subs and were two me
short each. Nine green stripe shirts defying their own claim that they were
extra large faced nine blue shirts proudly claiming their alliegence to the
"Athens Restaurant". Knowing they faced uncertain cardio-vascular health
after the second half of the first half, the greens blazed a new trail and play
positive football, booting a ball in the back of the net in the first five
minutes off a cross, off a head, off a chest. Green Gary MacIsaac was doing
the hands on hips walk within ten minutes. Others renewed their faith in the
lord praying out loud - "good God", "oh lord" etc. Realizing the game had
begun, Rob and Dave Douglas promptly walked through the greens and scored about
two minutes later. The game was tied and everyone did the only sensible
thing they could - lapse into a defensive shield. At half time, it was still
one to one. A few more players joined through the game and the sides grew to
roughly 11 to 11 - I say "roughly" as apparently counting bodies is a
subjective skill and one that is one of the first to go as binge drinkers enter
early middle age. About ten minutes intothe second half the greens had two
great turns of luck. Smedly went into the net for the blues and Dave Douglas -
a candidate for Panisonic player of the game to that point - pulled his solar
plexus or some other critical part of his body mass. Within a few minutes it
was 5-1. The game relaxed and while another goal was given to the blues via
a Smedly penalty shot placed firmly in the back of the net, the game was over
and the greens held victory for another year. <p>

I did not join in the Valhalla like events of the evening at the Grad House,
having to drive another two hours to add to the first four and a half of the
day - though I note that JR refused a beer for the road at the Lions Head. 
Yes, the Lion''s Head knew no Crows! I did not find out if another epic of
Crowetry was penned by Rob so if he did and others had it, scan it and I will
post it.<p>

<b>4. JR''s last word</b><p>

Jr wrote me this morning with the following message: "heard later you scored a nice goal on a header. sorry i missed it. must have been sucking... wind."<p>I was going to say I thought he was in the net I scored on at the time but it was Smed...</p>

There are strange things done in the Halifax sun,<br> by the men who went to King&#8217;s;<br>
As their bodies did rot they moved over to Watt<br> and started the queerest of things;<br>
They played with great might, beheld many a sight,<br> but the weirdest our eyes ever did fix,<br>
Was the day we reeled on the St. Francis Field,<br> and dared play in Crow Bowl Six.<p>
There was a man named Art who played his part,<br> he&#8217;d give the ball quite a boot<br>
With a maple leaf cookie and no chance of nookie,<br>he could often be heard saying &#8220;sploot.&#8221;<br>
He lived with the Wank who could be quite a crank,<br> especially when in need of smokes.<br>
The field was not far, especially by car,<br>the walking was for other blokes.<p>
The thirteenth of July we gave one more try,<br> our fitness was really a crime.<br>
Could we be so bold to assume we&#8217;re not old,<br> when gasping for air all the time?<br>
We warmed up on the field, last year&#8217;s wounds mostly healed,<br>thinking
&#8220;are we mice or men?&#8221;<br>
Our bellies are whiter these shirts seem much tighter,<br>and did these shorts shrink again?<p>
There was J.R. who saw Smed from afar,<br>his hand he offered to shake;<br>
From the sound of the shriek, we did not need to peek,<br>we knew he&#8217;d received a back rake.<br>
With Jar&#8217;s foot on his scrote<br>and a thumb to his throat,<br>his back all bloody and scarred;<br>
Things became scary when heard coming from Gary,<br>&#8220;If you don&#8217;t stop then youse are all barred.&#8221;<p>
With a pop and a crack, we now feel our back;<br>The pain we endure for the cup!<br>
There will be no hustle, I&#8217;ve just pulled a muscle<br>and we&#8217;ve only started the warm up.<br>
A gasp and a groan, with many a moan,<br>our muscles trembled with fear.<br>
For they hadn&#8217;t been used and now were abused,<br>why do we do this each year?<p>
We pursue the ball, the pain of it all,<br>there&#8217;s no joy not even a laugh.<br>
Our energies gone, we just can&#8217;t go on.<br>&#8220;What do you mean one more half!&#8221;<br>
We struggle some more despite the hamstring we tore<br>, just hoping to finish the day.<br>
With legs very stiff, we now get a whiff<br>of everyone&#8217;s old friend, Ben-Gay.<p>
We fall and we stumble, through parched lips we mumble,<br>&#8220;I just can&#8217;t believe all the pain.&#8221;<br> 
To the Grad House we go, our bellies in tow,<br> to start the abuse of our brains.<br>
But the damage we&#8217;ve done to our bodies for fun,<br>in comparison it truly pales.<br>
For our heads must be tougher, it is they that will suffer,<br>as we start in on a sextet of ales.<p>
True effort now starts as we peer over at Jart,<br> who is rubbing his hands with glee.<br>
He lays down the law and administers the claw,<br>to the stomach of poor old Smedley.<br>
They caused quite a hassle as they continued to wrassle,<br>neither using their brain,<br>
But his fortunes did change with a sight not so strange,<br>and through the ropes stepped Citizen Crain.<p>
The Love Train survived; made it out alive,<br> but he knew it could be undone.<br>
Dave then took a seat, but no night was replete<br>without the singing of Werewolves of London.<br>
Through all of the cheers and most of the beers<br>and many events quite insane.<br>
We had made it this far, but now must leave the bar,<br>empty glasses are all that remains.<p>
There are strange things done in the Halifax sun,<br>by the men who went to King&#8217;s;<br>
As their bodies did rot they moved over to Watt<br>and started the queerest of things;<br>
They played with great might, beheld many a sight,<br>but the weirdest our eyes ever did fix,<br>

Some seats are hopeless. And some seats are tantalizingly within reach.   As the campaign moves into its final days, look for the leaders to spend most of their time in ridings they just might, maybe, hopefully, win.<p>In metro, there are 16 seats, and more than half are impossible to call. In the rural mainland and Cape Breton, too, many ridings are considered extremely close. Here are 10 seats that are up for grabs. If the election remains close, these 10 could decide the provincial outcome.<ul><li>Dartmouth East: Jim Smith held this seat for the Liberals for 19 years, but has retired. Four years ago, Smith edged Terry Degen of the Tories by 264 votes, and Degen is back again. They are up against Joan Massey of the NDP.</li><li>Shelburne: Elections do not get any closer than this one did in &#8217;99. Conservative Cecil O&#8217;Driscoll and Liberal Clifford Huskilson tied, and O&#8217;Driscoll was awarded the victory after an official pulled his name out of a box. Huskilson, who represented the riding for years, is back for another shot. If it&#8217;s a tie again, let&#8217;s hope special dispensation is made &#8212; and both are awarded seats.</li><li>Cole Harbour-Eastern Passage: NDP MLA Kevin Deveaux defeated a Tory challenger by a slim 84 votes last time, his second straight election. This time, Deveaux is up against local councillor Harry McInroy, who is running for the Conservatives. Also in the race is Liberal Brian Churchill.</li><li>Pictou West: Fluff Baillie won this seat for the Tories last time, slipping past the NDP&#8217;s Charlie Parker by 147 votes. Baillie has since retired, and Parker, who won this seat in &#8217;98, is running again. The Tory banner is being raised by Paul Veniot.</li><li>Halifax Atlantic: John Buchanan held this riding for the Conservatives for more than 20 years; then, Robert Chisholm of the NDP was in for a decade. The Tories are represented by city Coun. Linda Mosher, the Liberals by former musician Ian McKinnon and the NDP by Michelle Raymond. All three major parties believe they have a good shot.</li><li>Preston: This small riding just north of Dartmouth is one of several in the province that has voted for each of the three major parties in the past three elections. Created in the early &#8217;90s to increase the likelihood of a black MLA, Preston has fewer than half the voters of most ridings.</li><li>Conservative MLA David Hendsbee is up against city councillor and former MLA Keith Colwell of the Liberals and the riding&#8217;s lone black candidate, the NDP&#8217;s Doug Sparks.</li><li>Annapolis: Conservative backbencher Frank Chipman is in a tough battle against Liberal Stephen McNeil in an area that historically moves back and forth between the two parties. In &#8217;99, Chipman beat McNeil by 761 votes.</li><li>Dartmouth South-Portland Valley: Another riding that has been won by all three parties in the past three elections. It&#8217;s presently held by Tim Olive, minister of Natural Resources. Olive won for the first time in &#8217;99, and became known as one of the legislature&#8217;s most partisan players. He is up against the NDP&#8217;s Marilyn More and Liberal Colin MacEachern.</li><li>Cape Breton Nova: New Democrat-turned- Labour Party-leader- turned-Liberal Paul MacEwan represented this industrial Cape Breton riding since 1970. After nine successful elections he has stepped aside, and is managing the campaign of Liberal Mel Crowe. He faces the NDP&#8217;s Gordie Gosse, who lost to MacEwan in &#8217;99.</li><li>Halifax Citadel: A battle of the titans; whoever wins will be a giant killer. It&#8217;s Health Minister Jane Purves versus Liberal Leader Danny Graham versus former NDP MLA Peter Delefes, in another riding the three major parties have won in the past three elections. </li><li>Purves is one of the stars of cabinet. Graham can expect some votes that almost always are awarded to party leaders. And Delefes has been going door to door since January.</ul></li><p>

Norm Nathan, the gentle voice of the night</b><p>by Jack Thomas, Globe Staff, 10/31/96<p> 
At the Colonial Theatre one night a few years ago, between acts of a play, I turned from the bar with a glass of wine in hand and saw a man I had admired since I was a teen-ager, Norm Nathan.<p>From 1957 to 1968, he had hosted an all-night jazz show on WHDH-AM, ``Sounds in the Night,'''' that nurtured Boston''s music community and kept a lot of us awake into the wee hours.<p> Beginning in 1984, his all-night talk-show weekends on WBZ-AM attracted night owls who loved his wry humor and his grand knowledge about the Boston experience.<p>Like a boy face to face with Roger Clemens, I approached, introduced myself and rudely gushed what a fan I was.<p>He thanked me, but seemed uncomfortable.<p>``I used to do my homework while listening to your jazz,'''' I said pompously, ``and now, I keep the radio on all     night to listen to you. My wife complains that I laugh so much I wake her up.''''<p>``Well,'''' he said, ``my dream has always been to leave the world a little sillier than I found it.'''' <p>     Norm Nathan left the world a little sillier, all right, but when he died Tuesday at age 70, he left a lot of fans who will miss his genial presence, his gentle voice and his droll humor.<p>``What he''d want to be remembered for is that jazz show,'''' said his friend Ron Della Chiesa of WGBH-FM.<p>Indeed, in the 1950s and 1960s, ``Sounds in the Night'''' on WHDH was as popular among college students as rock music on WBCN-FM a generation later. <p>The program featured not only great jazz, but also Nathan''s knowledgeable interviews with such musical   legends as Louis Armstrong, Dizzy Gillespie and Sarah Vaughan.<p>As Nathan recalled years later, ``In the beginning, management pressured me to play sloppy stuff, like Mantovani and Percy Faith. But I''d sneak in Count Basie and Ella Fitzgerald, and gradually, people got to like it.''''<p>For 41 years, he was married to Norma Nathan, author of the Boston Herald''s Eye column, until her death from cancer in 1991. <p>Although he engendered admiration and affection among listeners, Nathan was a modest man, without  pretense.<p>``I always found radio a glamorous way to show off to all the girls who wouldn''t go out with me in high school,'''' he said. <p>From 1984, the program he hosted through the night on WBZ drew listeners from Canada to Florida, and  Nathan was able to discourse with knowledge and wit about a range of subjects: food, literature, old actors, new music, the perils of escalators, lightning bugs, roguish politicians and the merits of large knots in neckties vs. small.<p>  ``I don''t want to sound like I''m sucking up to WBZ executives,'''' he said not long ago, ``but what I''m doing now is a lovely part of my life. I can stay up all night, act like an ass and no one says anything.'''' <p>One night, he took a call. <p>``Hello?'''' he said. <p>''''Hi, Norm,'''' said the caller. ``It''s Lorraine from Maine.'''' <p>There was a pause. <p>Nathan said, ``I''m resisting the temptation to ask if Lorraine from Maine stays mainly in the plain.'''' <p>Last winter, a caller complained about the weather. <p>``We''ve had so much snow,'''' she said. <p>``Well,'''' said Nathan, ``I guess somebody up there hates us.''''<p>    Calling from her hilltop home in Kentucky at 4:30 one morning, Martha spoke for many of Nathan''s listeners when she blurted, ``God, I love you!''''<p>Without him, radio now will be less fun. <p>Who will note the less than grand events in life, as Nathan did a few years ago in alerting listeners that New York was host to a convention of accordion players, and that 1,000 of them were performing in Central Park.<p>``It boggles the mind,'''' said Nathan. ``Imagine, hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of accordion players.''''<p> This story ran on page e1 of the Boston Globe on 10/31/96. <p><p>

<b>2.  Norm Nathan, radio disc jockey and talk host for 52 years dies at 70</b><p>By Tom Long, Globe Staff, 10/31/96<p>Norm Nathan, a disc jockey and talk show host who was a fixture on Greater Boston radio for 52 years, died Tuesday at his home in Middleton. He was 70.<p>A Boston native, Mr. Nathan began his broadcasting career in 1944 on WCOP. The job lasted only four weeks. His next job, at WESX in Salem, lasted a bit longer - five months. Station owners told him he had a speech impediment and mispronounced the letters ``r'''' and ``l.''''<p>It wasn''t until 1954, when he broadcast ``Barn Dance Jamboree'''' on WMEX live from the Cameo Room at the Hotel Avery and other Boston nightspots, that his career began to take off. From 1957 to 1969, he broadcast the ``Sounds
in the Night'''' show at WHDH, which replaced the recorded music previously played overnight on the station. When he moved to WEEI in 1974 to become a reporter at the all-news station, it was his choice: College students had dropped jazz for rock and he was unhappy about the music he was forced to play.<p>After a stint at WMEX, Mr. Nathan started a local newspaper with his wife, Norma, who later became a gossip columnist for the Boston Herald. Norma Nathan died in 1991. <p> A few more switches led him to WBZ, where he had hosted an overnight show since 1985. <p>Mr. Nathan had been a resident of Middleton since 1958. He served that community as president of the historical  society, a member of the board of trade, and town moderator for the past 19 years. <p>``I don''t think someone could last this long again,'''' Nathan told the Salem Evening News in an article on his 50th anniversary in radio in 1994. ``Now there is so much with television, cable and FM. Back then there was no FM.  There was no television and just a handful of AM stations.''''<p>In May 1994, his golden anniversary in broadcasting was celebrated at the Daniel Fuller House in Middleton. At the affair, Helene Beck of Belmont, a longtime listener, met Mr. Nathan for the first time. ``I''m a frequent caller to Norm,'' she said. ``I feel we''re good friends, we''ve talked so much. Even on politics we see eye to eye. I find myself looking    forward to weekend nights. It''s like a friend coming to visit. The best thing is, I can entertain him in bed and I don''t have to look my best.'''' <p>He leaves two daughters, Sonia Nathan Bradstreet of Danvers and Sarah J. Nathan of Middleton; and a sister, Barbara Coven of Randolph. <p>A funeral service will be held at 1 p.m. tomorrow in Temple Beth Shalom, Peabody. Burial will be in Oakdale Cemetery, Middleton. <p>

WQEW was the only place in New York where folks who listened to Tony Bennett, Frank Sinatra, and Ella Fitzgerald could tune in to hear their favorites. The Times then entered into an eight-year lease with Radio Disney, which will pipe its all-kids format on the 1560 frequency.<p>
The only word that I can think of to describe the Times'' decision to do this is "gutless."<p>Down through the years, we''ve said goodbye to WMCA (in 1970), WINS (in 1965), WMGM (in 1962), WABC    (in 1982), WHN (in 1987), WYNY (in 1996), and a few others that I might not be remembering. Each goodbye was a sad experience, but with each goodbye, we can look back with fond memories.<p> The December 27 loss of WQEW will not be remembered with fondness.   While some fans of the station have taken Disney to task for killing their favorite format, it is not Disney who did wrong this time. It is the people who run the New York Times. They are the folks who gagged the WQEW hosts. They are the folks who pulled the plug on the microphone for that final week of broadcasting. <p>A spokesperson for the Times was quoted as saying that the hosts would have nothing to say about the end of the station. She went on to say that their policy might change as the end drew closer. What she didn''t say was that the Times had no intention of giving these radio professionals their fair chance to end their runs
with dignity. What she didn''t say was that the Times was going to treat this group of professionals like a gaggle of kindergartners who couldn''t be counted on to say the right things.<p> The way the New York Times handled the end of WQEW was one of the biggest tragedies in the history of New York radio. This was an insult added to injury, and then sprinkled with salt. Somehow, I never imagined that the New York Times, one of the most respected newspapers in the country, would come out of this change smelling like ? well, like something that you wouldn''t want to step in.<p>Bob Jones, Lee Arnold, Stan Martin, Batt Johnson, Chuck Leonard, Holly Levis, Bill Jerome, and Jonathan Schwartz all deserved better. The folks who listened    faithfully to WQEW also deserved something better than commercials telling them where they could go after the plug was pulled. Actually, the Times telling us all where to go would have been better than what they did.<p>Cancel my subscription.<p><p> Vince Santarelli is the New York correspondent for RadioDigest.com.

Oh...and a milk for John Hamm.', '<div style="text-align: justify;">Wednesday, October 23, 1996<p>Campaign trail leads to famous watering hole<p>By David Swick<p> THE MIDTOWN TAVERN bubbled with the usual lunch crowd yesterday - and one long table of black and blue suits. At the head of the table was the man running for prime minister. "Do you know who that is?" I asked the dockworker lunching beside me.<p>"No."<p>"Jean Charest."<p>"Who?"<p>Jean Charest has a difficult task. The national leader of the Progressive Conservatives comprises half of his party''s members in the House of Commons. He''s 30 points behind in the polls. And his face and name are still not known by many Canadians. Here in Nova Scotia, he''s getting curious advice. Let''s compare meal deals.<p>Last week, Jean Chretien, John Savage, and Ron MacDonald had a spontaneous lunch at McDonald''s, and reaped
positive press depicting them as downhome folks.  So this week, top Tories eat at the Midtown, after announcing it the day before. Midtown waiters said that rather than draw a crowd the news appeared to scare some customers away. The Nova Scotia Tory leadership, however, was on hand to greet Charest. Terry Donahoe looked at ease, but everyone else appeared out of place. They
looked, in fact, like they would rather be down the street in the Prince George, enjoying filets and brandies.<p>There were little awkwardnesses. Provincial Tory leader John Hamm ordered milk. When Charest said hi to the third-ranking Tory in Nova Scotia, Ron Russell had to introduce himself by name. On a wall nearby was an enlarged photograph of Jean Chretien, beaming as he lifts three cases of Keith''s.<p>Midtown owner Doug Grant headed over to offer Charest a Midtown baseball cap. All of the other diners ignored
the Tory lunch party.<p>Chances are, that won''t always be the case. Charest stands an excellent chance of becoming prime minister. Even in
the great massacre of 1993, the PC party won more than two million votes. It still controls the Senate, is official Opposition in five provinces, and government in three. Charest is only 38. No one else in his party wants the job.<p>The Liberal plunge will come, and those votes will have to go somewhere. Where will they go? To regional parties? To Reform or the NDP? Most Canadians stick closer to the middle.<p>Of equal importance, Charest''s profile is a snug fit for the Canadian majority. He''s conservative, but not rabidly so.  He''s a Quebecois who has always been a Canadian nationalist. He''s cute: short and plump, with a wild mass of little-boy curls. He''s smart, and self-deprecating, and nice.<p>One gets the sense he knows this. Charest knows he will one day be prime minister, is eminently electable despite the hole his party is in. So it''s important to hear what he says now.<p>Some interesting points were raised after lunch, during a session with reporters and editors at The Daily News.  About his nine years'' service in the Mulroney government, Charest has "no qualms at all, and history will judge it (the
government) well." The next election will be fought on the future, not the past, "and anyone who raises (the Mulroney years) should be held in suspicion."<p>Charest regularly talks to all four living former Conservative leaders: Bob Stanfield, Joe Clark, Mulroney, and Kim
Campbell. (Praising the last Nova Scotian to lead the sometimes-fractious party, Charest recalled that after the 1993 election Stanfield quipped, "I envy the size of your caucus.")<p>
When Canadians vote for a leader, Charest said, we do so with three things in mind: we want someone who knows the country, someone who understands the problems, and someone with some idea what to do. In the next election, Charest said, "I just want (Canadians) to look at me, and decide if this is someone they want to entrust their country to."</div>', '2003-07-30 05:32:22', '2008-06-12 14:46:57.482542', 0, true, true, true, 'davidswick23', true);

It was an historic night for Nova Scotia - in several directions. The John Hamm Conservatives became only the third majority government in provincial history to fail to win a second majority. The Liberals placed third for the first time since Confederation. And the NDP cemented its standing in metro, and spread out from there. 
National history was made, too. Nova Scotia is now experiencing the tightest three-party era in Canadian history. Never before, in any province, have three parties shared the vote and seats so tightly in three straight elections.<p>There is justice in the results. This Tory government did not deserve a majority. Too many times it has acted arrogantly and without careful thought. Bill 68 attempted to make cabinet more powerful than the courts. Women''s shelter funding was attacked. The arts council became a political tool. And then came almost $1 billion in new spending promises, and $155 cheques for all.<p>
A majority would only have encouraged them.<p>
Metro punished the Tories by dropping their vote by more than six per cent. And two seats that the Tories needed to win a majority were lost in metro. Natural Resources Minister Tim Olive, who saw value in trees only when they were dead, was soundly defeated in Dartmouth South, and unimpressive backbencher Mary Ann McGrath lost in Clayton Park.<p>The NDP did not deserve to win. It has yet to provide a full policy platform to voters, and has yet to truly believe it can govern. Its support has also been too centred in metro, but last night the party finished second on the Eastern Shore, South Shore, Annapolis Valley, and northern mainland.<p>The NDP earned second place because it provided solid opposition, forcing the government to react to issues including health care for seniors, problems in schools, and the rising costs of insurance. <p>The Liberals deserved to come third. They barely showed up as opposition these past four years, preferring instead to find a new leader (Danny Graham), hide him for a year, and then try to sell him and a new platform in an election. Nova Scotians weren''t buying.<p>Graham did win his own seat, and there''s some justice in this, too. Graham will now have the opportunity to reveal to Nova Scotians who he is, and what he believes in.<p>As for the cabinet minister he defeated, perhaps smart and frank Jane Purves should consider a new job. Peter Kelly, look out!<p>The most disappointing number in yesterday''s election: the report that only 65 per cent of Nova Scotians voted. This would be our lowest turnout so far. Yes, it was raining, but John Hamm deserves most of the blame - for calling the vote on the sleepiest day in summer.<p>And so we head into minority government. <p>Bring it on.

People were shocked and saddened, but got to meet their neighbours. Power could be out for days, so thousands last night fired up barbecues. Throughout metro the post-Juan atmosphere was the rarest mixture: part tragedy, part Christmas morning.<p>Thousands of people were up earlier than usual yesterday, wandering out in grey light to survey the disaster. Those with battery radios reported that a state of emergency had been declared, and everyone asked to stay home. Sirens wailed, and a heavy rain began to fall.<p>Damage could be seen on every street. Trees had limbs snapped off. Trees were chopped in half. Trees were torn up by their roots, often ripping up sidewalks and concrete like so much paper.<p>I had seen one of these come down: a 15-metre-high tree pushed almost horizontal, then straighten, and finally flattened. It was ripped out of the earth whole, the base of its trunk pulling out a cake of earth four metres in diameter.<p>Trees fell on houses. Trees smashed cars. Three people were killed. Part of the shock was seeing these beautiful trees, our friends, not only destroyed but destroying as they fell.<p>By mid-morning, the rain had stopped, and chainsaws took the place of sirens. No electricity means no lights and hot water, but it also means no TV and computers. Without the usual distractions, people headed out of their homes and into the streets. Short walks turned into long excursions. The incredible must be seen to be believed.<p>Then the tropical sun came out, accompanied by balmy breezes. By early afternoon, thousands of people had gathered in downtown Halifax. Again the unique mixture: part carnival, part funeral.<p>Most stores were closed, but the few open restaurants did great business. One pizza joint had a letter torn asunder and so appeared to be offering &#8220;the Big Lice.&#8221; Santiago&#8217;s Seafood on Duke Street had a sign out advertising a Juan Special (pasta primavera).<p>The only day when all stores are closed and people are out and about is Christmas. Yesterday&#8217;s brilliant sun and warm breeze helped create the atmosphere you find in southern cities on Christmas Day. Except here there was a giddy edge: the extraordinary had occurred, plus this was an unexpected holiday.<p>After seeing the devastation in the Public Gardens &#8212; the south side is hardest hit, with massive trees lying on the ground &#8212; many people wandered to the waterfront. They had to avoid streets closed because of fallen glass. One window even fell from the premier&#8217;s office.<p>People expressed sadness over the death of John Rossiter, a paramedic killed when his ambulance was crushed by a fallen tree.<p>This horror added to a day many described as weird, unreal, or surreal. What terrible irony to be killed in a place where you worked to save lives.<p>People said, too, that despite hearing warnings of the hurricane&#8217;s approach, its ferocity took them by surprise. I can sympathize with this. Every winter we get several &#8220;heavy snowfall&#8221; warnings, but only rarely do we actually get a heavy snowfall. And the last hurricane we had, Hortense, seven years ago, was not like this.<p>The look of our city is changed because of the sudden, violent death of thousands and thousands of trees. Being a green city starts with trees. Trees add grace and beauty to every street in every season.<p>Only a small percentage were destroyed, but we need to immediately commit ourselves to replacing them. And when we plant new trees, which will one day grow to be as stately as the ones we lost, let us commemorate the people who died in this storm.<p>dswick@hfxnews.ca</div>', '2003-09-30 20:05:53', '2008-06-12 14:46:57.528546', 0, true, true, true, 'davidswick30', true);

o		In the last few years a number of new laws have come into existence on the issue of the protection of personal information:<p>
o		MFIPPA since 1990<br>
o		PIPEDA 1 January 2004<br>
&#61607;	Inter-provincial and Federally regulated since 1 January 2001<br>

o	PIPEDA applies to every organization in respect of personal information that:<p>
(a) 	the organization collects, uses or discloses in the course of commercial activities; or<p>
(b)	is about an employee of the organization and that the organization collects, uses or discloses in connection with the operation of a federal work, undertaking or business.<p>

o		Copyright and other intellectual property laws provide rights<br>
o		Licenses and other agreements related to your agreement also provide rights<p><p>
<b>4.	When do privacy interests conflict with GIS contracting?</b><p>
?	PIPEDA<p>
o		Requires that collection, use and disclosure be principled.   Municipalities may fall under PIPEDA through the generality of a number of its key terms and phrases:  &#8220;organization&#8221;, &#8220;personal information&#8221; and &#8220;commercial activities&#8221;.   Under section 4(1), the combined presence of these terms is required for PIPEDA to apply:<p>   
This Part applies to every organization in respect of personal information that:<p>
(a)	the organization collects, uses or discloses in the course of commercial activities; or<p>
(b)	is about an employee of the organization and that the organization collects, uses or discloses in connection with the operation of a federal work, undertaking or business.<p>
o		&#8220;Organization&#8221;<p>
Section 1 of PIPEDA defines "organization" as including an association, a partnership, a person and a trade union.    Section 35 of the Federal Interpretation Act,  RSC 1985, c.I-21 states that the word "person," or any word or expression descriptive of a person, includes a corporation.  Similar wording exists in section 29(1) of Interpretation Act, R.S.O. 1990, c.I.11.   Under section 4 of the Municipal Act, 2001, S.O. 2001, c.25:<p>  
The inhabitants of every municipality are incorporated as a body corporate.<p>
Municipal corporations, therefore, are &#8220;persons&#8221; under law and therefore &#8220;organizations&#8221; for purposes of PIPEDA.<p>
o		&#8220;Personal Information&#8221;<p>
The second broad term used in PIPEDA is &#8220;personal information&#8221;.  Section 5(1) of the PIPEDA states, subject to sections 6 to 9, every organization shall comply with the obligations set out in Schedule 1.    Schedule 1 sets out a number of broad principles which must be followed in the handling of &#8220;personal information.&#8221;     Personal information is defined under section 2(1) of PIPEDA as follows:<p>
"personal information" means information about an identifiable individual, but does not include the name, title or business address or telephone number of an employee of an organization.<p>
What is not required for data to fall into this definition is that the data be a comprehensive set of data about a person or that the data itself identifies the person.   Partial data which can identify a person when combined with other data is also personal information.   All it needs to do is &#8220;relate&#8221; to the person.<p>
o		&#8220;Commercial Activities&#8221;<p>
The third term is &#8220;commercial activities.&#8221;   An organization falls under PIPEDA if it collects, uses or discloses personal information in the course of &#8220;commercial activities.&#8221;     Commercial activities are defined in section 2(1) of PIPEDA:<p>
"commercial activity" means any particular transaction, act or conduct or any regular course of conduct that is of a commercial character, including the selling, bartering or leasing of donor, membership or other fundraising lists.<p>
A review of the meanings contained in &#8220;any particular transaction, act or conduct or any regular course of conduct that is of a commercial character&#8221; confirmed that this.  Any procurement would qualify as a transaction.     From the vending side of commerce the definition &#8220;any regular course of conduct that is of a commercial character&#8221; should include any service that places the City in the marketplace.  Examples would be nursing homes, arena or other facility rentals and gas or electric utilities.<p>
?	Cases:<p>
PIPEDA is not the only source in law confirming municipalities take part in commercial activities.  The Courts have found that municipalities participate in commercial activities in other contexts.   Shell Canada Products Ltd. v. Vancouver (City), [1994] 1 S.C.R. 231:<p>
?"there are many considerations applicable to public bodies and not to private which may justify different treatment of the two, even when engaged in similar activity".  The most important difference is the fact that municipalities undertake their commercial and contractual activities with the use of public funds? (at para. 11)<p>
While they are not identical to private organizations, the activities of municipalities in the marketplace can be characterized as a commercial activity.   In the case, Reference re: Goods and Services Tax (Can.), [1991] A.J. No. 866, the Alberta Court of Appeal noted:<p>
&#8220;Public sector bodies" which include federal and provincial governments, charities, non-profit organizations, municipalities, universities, public colleges, school authorities and hospital authorities, must collect and remit the tax to the extent that they engage in commercial activities.   Certain activities of governments and municipalities are "deemed" to be commercial activities for the purpose of the GST Act.  While provincial governments themselves are not liable to pay tax on their purchases, various entities created by provincial governments such as municipalities, universities, public colleges, public hospitals, schools and school authorities (the "MUSH sector") are liable to pay tax.  (at para 6)<p>
Again, in  J.P. Towing Service and Storage Ltd. v. Toronto (Metropolitan Police Services Board) [1999] O.J. No. 3959:<p>
Call them mere commercial transactions, but they are nonetheless within the ambit of a power granted to the municipal governments, and what is important is the fact that municipalities undertake their commercial and contractual activities with the use of public funds.<p>
As a result, it is fair to say it is not the profit motive but the transactional and revenue/expenditure activity which triggers the application of PIPEDA.     Personal data received through the non-commercial transactions in the nature of taxes, penalties, fees and charges are not included in the Act where those occur in the non-commercial, non-market context.   These would including licensing, parking fines, rates, planning charges as the municipality is an effective non-commercial monopoly in relation to these matters.<p>
?	Exceptions<p>
There are exceptions in PIPEDA.  There are important exceptions to PIPEDA set out in the Act or regulations.  Personal information does not include:<p>
o	Employment: the name, title or business address or telephone number of an employee of an organization: PIPEDA, s. 2(1).<p>
It is important to note that all other information in relation to an employee is personal information &#8211; email address, employment records, health information and performance memos under PIPEDA.  The issue is whether employment records are commercial activity.    If we consider just hiring records, and especially competition records of those not hired, we can see that there may be aspects of employment records that could be considered commercial.<p>
o		Telephone Directories: personal information consisting of the name, address and telephone number of a subscriber that appears in a telephone directory that is available to the public, where the subscriber can refuse to have the personal information appear in the directory: Regulations Specifying Publicly Available Information, P.C. 2000-1777 13 December, 2000, sec. 1(a); <p>
o		Business Directories: personal information including the name, title, address and telephone number of an individual that appears in a professional or business directory, listing or notice, that is available to the public, where the collection, use and disclosure of the personal information relate directly to the purpose for which the information appears in the directory, listing or notice: Reg. 2000-1777, sec. 1(b); <p>
o		Public Registries: personal information that appears in a registry collected under a statutory authority and to which a right of public access is authorized by law, where the collection, use and disclosure of the personal information relate directly to the purpose for which the information appears in the registry: Reg. 2000-1777, sec. 1(c).<p>
The MPAC assessment rolls would be an example of such a registry but only when used for purposes under the Act.<p>  
Q:	if derived data is then sold in digital form for use in a GIS application has the purpose changed and is barred under PIPEDA?;<p>
o		Court or Tribunal Records: personal information that appears in a record or document of a judicial or quasi-judicial body, that is available to the public, where the collection, use and disclosure of the personal information relate directly to the purpose for which the information appears in the record or document: Reg. 2000-1777, sec. 1(d); and <p>
o		Public Press: personal information that appears in a publication, including a magazine, book or newspaper, in printed or electronic form, that is available to the public, where the individual has provided the information: Reg. 2000-1777, sec. 1(e).', '2003-10-29 19:04:41', '2008-06-12 14:46:57.546765', 0, true, true, true, 'notesfor', true);

Queen&#8217;s-led study to find out</h4> by Jonathan Barrett, Monday, November 17, 2003 - 07:00<p>Local News - Some people might describe David Lyon as paranoid. The Queen&#8217;s sociology professor refuses to give out his postal code. He was at a downtown store a couple of days ago and was asked for his postal code by the cashier. &#8220;I refused to give it to her,&#8221; Lyon said. &#8220;But the reason that she wants it is because a postal code reveals a lot about us in terms of lifestyle, income levels and home ownership. To the corporation, the postal code is a means of judging how much that customer&#8217;s business is worth.&#8221; <p>Lyon&#8217;s research colleague, Queen&#8217;s business professor Yolande Chan, says that companies sell that personal information. &#8220;If I&#8217;m willing to sell your data to someone else who has data of you, say your telephone company or your bank or your credit card company,&#8221; she said, &#8220;I start to put all these items together, I can develop some very interesting theories about who you are.&#8221; <p>If a customer has a card with the organization, past purchases are also on record and may be added to your profile, Chan said. &#8220;You may get a very different treatment than someone else in a different part of town.&#8221; This is &#8220;social sorting,&#8221; a means of discriminating between different groups to provide different treatment. <p>Lyon, Chan and Elia Zureik are part of a Queen&#8217;s-led project that has been awarded $1.9 million to study the impact of the flow of personal information. The money comes from the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council, a federal granting agency. &#8220;Our main concern is to find out what people really know about what happens to the data that is gathered about them,&#8221; said Zureik, who&#8217;s in charge of the international survey component of the project that covers at least 11 countries.<p>There has been an increase in interest for commercial data by law enforcement agencies after the terrorist attacks in the United States on Sept. 11, 2001, Lyon said. &#8220;What we come up with may have some implications for security type policies, but what we are really interested in is just understanding the increased trafficking of personal data.&#8221; <p>According to Lyon, who heads the international research team, employment may be influenced by the sorting phenomena. The group also wants to find out whether the public is comfortable with the amount of information that is known about them in the commercial and government sectors. he researchers are hoping to gain an understanding of where society is headed if surveillance continues to increase. <p>Jean-Serge Brisson says he already knows. &#8220;The minute they put up a camera, we&#8217;ve gone too far,&#8221; said Brisson, the leader of the Libertarian Party of Canada. In a phone interview from Ottawa, Brisson said Canadians face a no-win situation.   As an example, he said, authorities would have to continually install more cameras in public places to cover the areas that the other ones miss. &#8220;On private property, have all the cameras you like,&#8221; he said.<p>But on public property, one won&#8217;t be enough. &#8220;It never stops.&#8221; He said the good intentions of governments can create unacceptable restrictions on its citizens. Brisson cites the attempt to protect citizens from harmful drugs.<p>
&#8220;How far do we go?&#8221; Authorities may have to put a soldier in every house, he said. The research project will try to raise public awareness while stimulating debate on surveillance issues. Neither paranoia nor complacency are useful responses, according to Lyon.</div>', '2003-11-17 17:46:24', '2008-06-12 14:46:57.561784', 0, true, true, true, 'articleonqueens', true);

How is it that ITAP, the putative trade organization of the IT industry on PEI, can so effectively take an interesting idea like open source and make it sound completely dreadful?<p>

I ask this only partly rhetorically: I really would like to know whether ITAP purposely sets out to forward a bunged up world view, or whether they''re trying really, really hard to be relevant and interesting but just can''t seem to manage to pull it together.<p>

I mean, really, here''s a movement that has radical and interesting ideas at its core, and ITAP''s plan for open source evangelizing involves importing someone whose job title is "Manager, Enterprise Architecture IT Standards, Architecture and Security Sector, Telecommunications and Informatics Program, PWGSC."<p>

If that isn''t bad enough, the formal proceedings are followed by "an hour-long ''visioning'' exercise that would begin to establish the industry objectives for an Open Systems Centre of Excellence."<p>

Yah, that sounds like fun.<p>

I can''t for the life of me figure this out; it seems a lot like trying to capture butterflies in a bottle, and sucking all the freedom and beauty out in the process. <p>

"radical and interesting ideas" are scary, I''m afraid.<p>Dull and boring is businesslike, and professional-sounding. Changing the world by making something people don''t have to pay you for (a gross oversimplification, in reality, since one is only required to supply the source of your program to the people you supply the binary to under the GPL) doesn''t sound very good for business. So they need to obfuscate the scary bits into oblivion. <p>

At least ITAP recognizing that open source is no longer just a buzzword used by Wired magazine but a real alternative for business computing. Too bad it''s only starting to catch on now.<p>


I''ve been working with a company for 3 years that relies on open source software to do business and while a lot of our .com competition has dissapeared we remain profitable and in the black. Mostly due to open source software''s reliability, customizability, security and lower TCO. In short, we get more done for less money. Our top execs love open source software because it makes perfect business sense.<p>


That''s not to say that open source is perfect for everything but it certainly has it''s place. <p>


I dream of a day when I can earn a respectable salary from a company in PEI working on open source solutions. If ITAP can help business in PEI accept open source software then more power to them. <p>

How would a Centre of Excellence for Open Source work? I can presume that I have not visioned enough if I have to ask that question but isn''t the whole point, in addition to the radical innovation you have noted, Peter, that these things are by necessity decentralized as Dave W. wrote of on Sunday? Where is the left field in a Centre? <p>

Yes it does _sound_ boring, not written up in a particularly exciting way, and maybe a bit "bunged up". Perhaps it''s best to read between the lines. ITAP is interested. Government is interested. They''re all starting to realize Open Source is important, and that we in PEI should be prepared so the majority of business doesn''t get "steamrolled" by it. But really everyone doesn''t quite understand it all yet. <p>

That''s part of the reason for the meeting. What is exciting is that ***our government** through PWGSC is making changes internally that support open-source. (You have heard of the activity in governments in Munich etc?...) Peter I''d encourage you to come. I think a lot of good *could* come out of us all thinking and working together... not unlike the spirit of GPL.<p>

Peter, catchy title! Cody and Al, I appreciated your reasoned and fair responses. Alan, good point.<p>


Just to give you a bit of history on ITAP''s involvement on the Open Systems (OS) front. A year and a half ago, ITAP in partnership with ITAP member firm Engineering Technologies Canada developed a Letter of Intent for the Atlantic Innovation Fund (AIF)that would see a Centre of Excellence for OS training and R&D located here on the Island. Thus, the high fallutin''name and project that attempted to position Charlottetown at the CENTRE of Open Systems development in Atlantic Canada. After the "Letter of Intent" stage in the process, we were co-opted into another member''s AIF proposal which was unsuccessful as of this past summer.<p>


Although strategically it may not have been the best idea to have a couple of "federallies" in for a session to kick off OS discussion, but I always saw this original session as an "info" session that would not scare anyone in the private and government sectors. Some members are quite comfortable with the evolution of OS, but it scares the hell out of others I''m sure. Also, ITAP couldn''t afford to bring a private person in ourselves (I know what you are thinking...why not one of our own?...did a luncheon for OS and noone showed...Islanders don''t come to listen to their own...generalization, but sooo true) . <p>


Anyway, I apologize for making it sound so boring. Sometimes I concentrate so much on the facts that I forget that I have to sell it. <p>


I do hope you will all take it in though. ITAP is looking a very small initiative to start the ball rolling towards building OS community and capabilities while promoting those OS capabilities here on the Island to the rest of the World. <p>


That can''t be a bad thing now can it? I hope you will leave my comments up this time...thank you for the opportunity! <p>

RE: open source centre... (The "excellence" part is overused.) Could you see a place where there are a variety of hardware and software platforms that you could test software on? Suse, Redhat, bluecat, embedix, uclinux - Servers, desktops, set-top box, embedded mobile wireless devices? <p>

Centres are easy to build and promote and control.<p>

Fringes are hard to define. What effect did Excellent Government Policy Lobby have in Helsinki when Linus made Linux?<p>


Could ITAP convince the province to buy only open license from here on out? That would be impressive, showing leadership behind the scenes. But then I haven''t got a clue what percent of OS is open license on the provinces desktops and servers? I bet it''s mostly Microsoft. <p>

The Province is 100% Linux on the webserver side (there''s a Windows NT box used for the MapGuide system, although it''s gradually being migrated to an open source MapServer system). Apache is the webserver, and PHP the development environment. Sybase (not open source) is used as the database back-end, mostly because of a large legacy investment in Microsoft SQL server.<p>


The recent Provincial and Municipal elections were 100% open source on the web and back end sides: everything from confirmation forms to lists of electors to results management were developed with open source tools.<p>

Holland College has steadfastly refused to be involved in open source/ Linux/ Unix/ (anything other than Novell) over the past dozen years or so, UPEI is catching up rapidly, but there aren''t anywhere nearly enough people using and understanding Linux (or any ''nix) and everything that brings about.<p>


This is a rare departure for me in that I support a supply-side approach because of the overall benefit this learning would have on anyone in any profession, no matter their job or role. The janitor will be better able to work in the 21st C with an open source background; put it this way, if I saw it on a resume for cleaning staff it would be the difference if all else was equal. Unix is always an asset.<p>


Have you any idea how long I''ve been out on my own on this one? Anyway, in the mean time, I don''t care how it sounds as long as they say "linux". Years before I met anyone whom I now respect in this industry I was pushing this and it''s finally come far enough up the pipe to catch some attention at the top (wherever that is). (I wish I had saved the exchange from 15 years ago in which Derek MacEwen (VAC-DVA Derek) and I hashed this out with me saying "in the future all computer users will be using UNIX or a derivative". Anyone who has ever used the Internet fits that description to a T.)<p>


I''m willing to give ITAP (and PEI) some time on this -- I won''t worry about the aesthetics but I am concerned about content and direction.<p>


It should be well received by many of you that a recent attempt by ITAP to address overall HR issues which made no specific mention of Linux, open source, or UNIX; was essentially shot down at the board level for that reason. We''re moving along y''know.<p>


Regardless, even without open source, the current ED has moved ITAP into a position very likely to produce results which benefit all IT firms (members or not).<p>


Clumsy or not, ITAP is on this one (better LATE than never). I sure hope everyone gives this process their best (and if that means they stay away because they can''t stand it -- I suppose that''s a good reason).<p>

Let''s call open source "playing on the beach" and closed source "being in prison."<p>


ITAP''s solution to noticing that many in its community are in prison is to organize a prison-like meeting wherein the imprisoned will be preached to about (or "visioneered with about") the value of playing on the beach.<p>


The thing is by bringing open source into the stale confines of the ITAP technocracy, all of its beauty and elegance will be immediately and effectively rendered invisible, much as having the prison wardens trying to educate the inmates about how to frolic would be a failed endeavour.
<p>

Open source simply is: it doesn''t need sales jobs, pep rallies, meetings, visioning sessions, or centres for excellence, all of which are trappings of the closed-source world where profit and obfuscation are the goals.<p>


There is a reason that there are no training courses for anarchists. <p>

While in Toronto a while back, I "did lunch" with a friend who was, in fact, going to Anarchist training. <p>


As for the beach analogy; I don''t buy it, but I''ll gladly take it a step further. Once the prisoners DO get out of prison, it will be helpful for them to know to have put sunblock on; otherwise they will get burned. Burned bad. <p>

My taking your analogy further was meant to be as playful as your creating it in the first place. Time to go home I guess ;)<p>


BUT, is open source really just "is"... Open Source doesn''t just mean running Apache instead of IIS, or using PHP as a script interpreter. It''s a little more scary than that for most businesses and governments. A lot of work goes in to helping OSS move into new areas. <p>


I think there are people who feel a passion for OSS and just want to promote it, there are those who feel a need for it to be prominent (there are local companies who can''t hire people who know *nix systems fast enough), and there are people who just want to use it if it makes sense. There is no problem acknowledging that you are in one group, but there are others out there. <p>

Jevon says It''s a little more scary than that for most businesses and governments. A lot of work goes in to helping OSS move into new areas.<p>


My experience suggests that is absolutely and completely not the case: for at least the past five years, open source has been an easy sell for both my government and corporate clients. It hasn''t even been a sell, it has just been the logical route to take.<p>


If open source software can run the provincial election -- where everything absolutely, positively has to work -- there''s not much it can''t do.<p>


I suppose I''ve no real problem with a bunch of folks getting together to talk about open source, even if it does sound kind of contorted and dorky. I just think it might be more fun to, say, host a rock concert instead. <p>

Is your point, Peter, that because the biggies in the market have already bought, this is too many years behind? You are probably right if selling core systems to government is your market. It would seem to me that an opportunity to discuss other markets and ways to work together is not a waste of time, which is what most small PEI vendors and developers would have to do given the marketplace. But you are right on the money that it is absolutely nothing new and there is nothing leading edge about it. I wouldn''t worried about the contorted dork thing, either, as that pretty much covers anyone in the general area including blog posters. <p>

Jevon, the site you link to prompts me to fully realize the folly of the ITAP initiative: open source software is not a product, it''s a process. As such, to understand it, you need to participate in it.<p>


The ITAP seminar seems akin to holding a seminar for prospective parents about the value of having children: no matter how hard you try, you are never going to accurately (or even partially accurately) be able to capture the experience.<p>


In other words, if you want to understand open source, just do it. <p>

Jevon
Wednesday, December 3, 2003 at 11:56 AST [LINK]<p>
I think I am missing a part of your argument. Because something is not a product, it does necessarily follow that to understand it you must immediately participate in it. <p>


I am with you for the most part, and don''t really feel like taking this further. Whatever ITAP does for its members that has to do with Open Source and Open Standards will have a life all on its own because it is the members who are pushing it forward. <p>


Kevin is right about ITAP changing. I didn''t know the organization in it''s heyday of being disliked, but I do know that it is a hardworking organization that actually does help its members. Some of those members are getting curious about Open Source and other members are getting serious about helping them out. Peer to peer, blah blah blah,. not top-down.<p>


Selling open source to clients for 5 years? We''ve all been doing that, and you are right; it was never even a sales job, it is just the way it is. No seminar needed. However, there are many companies out there for who OSS doesn''t just mean running apache, it means either building OS applications, or using them day to day. This means they need support, custom development, a detailed transition plan, and all that jazz. <p>


At the end of the day, it''s just a different audience. They have different needs than a Peter Rukavina or Jevon MacDonald. You may not see the beauty in their curiosity, but I do. We''ve been thinking about OSS for a long time now, and a lot of people are just noticing it for the first time. <p>

Sandy, I consider all email to be confidential. Most people, I think, feel the same way.<p>


I would hope especially that the director of a trade organization, one who needs to be concerned with both being and appearing to be discrete and neutral, would take extra pains to not reveal details of private email to anyone.<p>


If you take personal umbrage at my public criticisms of the organization, please don''t: I''m engaged in rhetoric here, not ad hominem attacks.<p>


Your assumptions that because you obscure the details of the email, it''s okay to discuss in public, to say nothing of your assumptions that I want new business, that I want you to help secure me new business, or, indeed, that I''m actually in a business that falls under your area of interest are equally distasteful.<p>


If I want your help, I will ask for it. If you want to discuss private correspondence between me any anyone else in public, I would hope that, in future, you would extend me the courtesy of asking my permission. <p>

Passing on the most recent exchange, Peter you wrote:
"Open source simply is: it doesn''t need sales jobs, pep rallies, meetings, visioning sessions, or centres for excellence, all of which are trappings of the closed-source world where profit and obfuscation are the goals.
There is a reason that there are no training courses for anarchists."
Open source ought to be ringing from every school bell and town hall in the country. I''ve been trying to drag some decision makers closer to this for years &#8211; and perhaps your point is those who don''t understand it never will so quit trying &#8211; but I still believe that for every hundred or so Linux-weenies we produce, there''ll be a dozen or so who''ll have some of the basic concepts of open sourceness.
Y''know this is the basic issue which put me at odds with the management at PEINet. See, I grew up in a world where the Internet was composed of a few campuses of smart people who shared things and worked together to get things done. If the Internet had been left to the kind of people you so frequently dismiss in this blog we would not be having this discussion because you are correct if you think the Internet wouldn''t have evolved. Thank God it wasn''t profit motivating the earliest Internet pioneers!
Anyway, that campus-to-campus thing led to a netiquette which included things like don''t send spam and don''t break other people''s computers. I was able to accomplish a lot while at PEINet when I was plugged into that community via the usenet. As time went on it became more and more difficult to continue those contacts (we were essentially forced to waste our time listening to "professionals" and consultants who would sell us a sixteen port modem rack for $100K &#8211; knowing full well that we could only have a ratio of ten to one (customers to port), and that the max per person per month was about thirty dollars... and well, you do the math. Nothing made sense any more. Nothing).
Yes governments and pin-striped wankers from all over the place flooded into the market (remember the "michelin man") and began to carve out their profit while killing the spirit which brought the Internet into being in the first place.
Peter, you are absolutely right about what has been done and you are absolutely wrong about how we don''t need pep rallies. We need, now more than ever, for you and those who think like you, to make your message scintillatingly clear to the entire world. It has to be done in language that wankers can understand, it has to be done in a loving non-threatening way, and it has to be done for free.
And you have to do it.
I wish it were otherwise because you''ve given so much already &#8211; some of which is appreciated in approximate proportion to its contribution; most of it isn''t. <p>

CHARLOTTETOWN  &#8212;  Premier Pat Binns and Treasurer Mitch Murphy barely had a chance to sit during Thursday''s question period. Both were defending the way the Tories have been handling the province''s finances.<p>

Murphy has reported both last year''s deficit,and this year''s, are well above what was forecast. Last year''s final figure was ten times what was expected. A total deficit of $83.3 million.<p>

That revelation followed a new estimate that this year''s deficit will climb to $53.3 million, over $40 million more than expected.<p>

Opposition leader Robert Ghiz told the legislature on Thursday he had 83 million questions about last year, and 53 million about the current financial year.<p>

He accused the premier, and his government, of hiding how bad the province''s finances really were. He said the Tories didn''t share the news until after the election in order to help win a third mandate.<p>

Ghiz said Pat Binns placed his personal political goals ahead of the province''s finances.<p>

Ghiz also reminded Binns of comments he made before taking office in 1996. He said it should be against the law to run deficits.<p>

The Binns government has delivered three deficit budgets in a row.<p>

Both Pat Binns and Mitch Muprhy told the house the deficit isn''t entirely their fault.<p>

They blamed Ottawa for taking away some of the transfer payments it had sent to the province. Almost $8 million was lost from province''s pension fund, something they said was the fault of soft stock markets.<p>

However, Mitch Murphy had to admit the government departments are spending more than they are allowed.<p>

Ontario Superior Court of Justice <br>
Benotto J. <p>

Heard: September 8-11, 2003. <br>
Judgment: January 21, 2004. <p>


1.     On April 5, 2001, a brown paper envelope arrived anonymously at the Ottawa office of the National Post. It was addressed to Andrew McIntosh, an investigative journalist who was working on a project concerning the Prime Minister''s business dealings in his riding of St. Maurice, Quebec. Of particular interest was the involvement, if any, of the Prime Minister in the sale of the Grand-M&egrave;re Golf Club in St. Maurice. The document contained in the envelope purports to be a loan authorization for the golf club which provides for the repayment of debt owed to a Chr&eacute;tien family holding company. This, if true, may have placed the Prime Minister in a conflict of interest. <p>

2.      The RCMP applied for and obtained search warrants to compel production of the envelope and its contents: a general warrant pursuant to section 487.01 of the Criminal Code and an assistance order pursuant to 487.02. The National Post seeks to have the warrants quashed. It is supported by the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (the CBC) and the Globe and Mail, which were granted intervenor status. <p>

3.      There are several grounds relied on to challenge the warrants. The primary one is the fact that disclosure of the documents would reveal the identity of a confidential source. The media argue that the proposed search and seizure would constitute a serious and unjustifiable infringement of their rights to freedom of expression under the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms and would breach a privilege at common law. The Crown argues that the documents are necessary for the investigation of a criminal offence. <p>

FACTS <p>

4.      Andrew McIntosh''s first stories about the Prime Minister''s investment in the golf club appeared in the National Post on Saturday, January 23, 1999 and Monday, January 25, 1999. He focused much of his investigation on the Prime Minister''s financial interests in the Grand-M&egrave;re Inn and the Grand-M&egrave;re Golf Club and on the flow of federal loans, grants and contracts to businesses in the Prime Minister''s riding of St. Maurice. Of particular interest to Mr. McIntosh and importance to the development of the story was a $615,000 loan given to the Grand-M&egrave;re Inn in September 1997 by the Business Development Bank of Canada ("the Bank"), a federal Crown corporation involved in financing small and medium-sized businesses across Canada. Mr. McIntosh first learned of the loan through a land registry search he conducted on the Grand-M&egrave;re Inn. <p>

5.      As a result of these stories, Mr. McIntosh was contacted by people who became confidential sources of information. The stories sparked a national debate both in and out of the House of Commons, led the Prime Minister to write to the National Post, and caused Mr. McIntosh to continue investigating and publishing stories on the topic. <p>

6.      During the fall of 2000, Mr. McIntosh was contacted by a confidential source "Y" who said he/she had a matter of great public importance to discuss provided a promise of confidentiality was given. Y said he/she was also speaking on behalf of another source "X" who did not want to speak directly, fearing reprisals. Mr. McIntosh gave a blanket, unconditional promise of confidentiality to protect the identity of both X and Y. <p>

7.      At this time, there were five separate RCMP investigations ongoing into the awarding of federal government loans and grants in the riding of the Prime Minister, four regarding allegations of theft and fraud, and a fifth involving alleged unlawful lobbying by a lobbyist and unpaid aide to the Prime Minister. As well, the Grand-M&egrave;re Inn had defaulted on its loan repayments to the Bank and there were a growing number of liens for unpaid taxes and other debts registered against the Inn by governments and creditors. <p>

8.      Pursuant to his promise of confidentiality, Mr. McIntosh received a number of documents. A private meeting was held at Y''s home. Mr. McIntosh was given some documents and only shown others. This information led him to other confidential sources from whom he received more information. The subsequent stories in the National Post gave rise to significant political controversy. There were calls in the media and in the House of Commons for the resignation of the Prime Minister. The stories and the investigation continued. All of Mr. McIntosh''s work was done with the support of the then Editor-in-Chief Kenneth Whyte. <p>

9.      On the morning of April 5, 2001, Mr. McIntosh received a sealed, plain brown envelope addressed to him. It was in the daily mail delivery at the Ottawa Bureau of the National Post. The envelope bore no return address. It was a copy of a document that appeared to be an internal Business Development Bank of Canada loan authorization. It was signed by identifiable officers of the Bank. It related to the $615,000 mortgage loan that the Bank had granted to the Grand-M&egrave;re Inn in August 1997. Of particular significance to Mr. McIntosh was a statement in the financial footnotes that the Inn was showing a debt of $23,040 to "JAC Consultants." J. & AC Consultants Inc. is a Chr&eacute;tien family holding company. <p>

10.      Mr. McIntosh testified that he and his colleagues at the National Post realized that if the document was genuine, it was extremely sensitive and its contents, if proven to be accurate, could have dire political and other consequences for the career of the Prime Minister. Mr. McIntosh forwarded a copy of the document to the Bank, to the Prime Minister''s Office, and to David Scott, counsel for the Prime Minister, requesting their comments about its contents. <p>

11.      The Bank stated that the document appeared to be a copy of part of the Bank''s record. The Bank wrote two letters to the National Post on April 6, 2001. The first letter stated that the document was a forgery because there was no record of the $23,040 debt owing to J. & AC Consultants in the Bank''s own records. The second letter stated that the National Post was in possession of a confidential Bank document, the contents of which could not be disclosed. The Prime Minister''s Office and Mr. Scott also took the position that the document was a forgery. They specifically denied that the Prime Minister was ever owed any money by the Grand-M&egrave;re Inn. On April 7, 2001, the Bank contacted the RCMP and requested that it undertake an investigation into the origin of the document. <p>

12.      The National Post decided not to publish details of the purported $23,040 debt referred to in the document. However, other news organizations published and broadcast details that purported to show that the Inn had an unpaid debt of $23,040 to JAC Consultants in 1997. Questions raised in the House of Commons concerning the disputed loan authorization document made it clear that others had received copies of it as well. <p>

13.      During the week following the receipt of the envelope by Mr. McIntosh, X contacted him requesting a meeting. This was Mr. McIntosh''s first contact with X. At the meeting, X requested an undertaking of confidentiality. It was given even though that promise had already been given in the earlier discussions with Y. Confidential source X then revealed that he/she was the person who had mailed the loan authorization document. Mr. McIntosh satisfied himself that X was in fact the source. X asked him to destroy it so that he/she would not be identified through DNA or fingerprint analysis. Mr. McIntosh testified that he was told that X was concerned that he/she and his/her family might suffer if ever identified. Mr. McIntosh refused to destroy the document but took steps to secure it. Mr. McIntosh told X that as long as he believed he was not being misled, the undertaking of confidentiality would remain binding. Mr. McIntosh researched the origins of the document. He stated under oath that he is satisfied X is a reliable source. He was satisfied the loan authorization was genuine. If it is in fact a forgery, he has stated that he does not believe that X knew that. He, therefore, believes the promise of confidentiality remains binding. <p>

14.      The police seek the documents to obtain information concerning possible offences under the Criminal Code and to conduct forensic examination of the items (including DNA analysis and fingerprinting) with a view to identifying the person who sent the loan authorization document to Mr. McIntosh. They need the documents to establish that the loan authorization document sent to Mr. McIntosh is a forgery. <p>

15.      The RCMP investigation was assigned to Corporal Roland Gallant of the Montreal Commercial Crime Section. He spoke to counsel for the National Post about a search warrant. During these discussions, counsel for the National Post asked for an opportunity to appear at the application before the issuing Justice. She made the request because she was concerned about the constitutional violation resulting from the disclosure of a confidential source. Notice was not given to counsel. <p>

16.      On July 4, 2002, the Honourable Mr. Justice Khawly of the Ontario Court of Justice issued a general warrant and assistance order. By their combined effect, the Editor-in-Chief of the National Post was to locate the documents in question and make them available to Corporal Gallant. The general warrant and assistance order were served on the National Post on July 5, 2002. <p>

17.      This application to quash the general warrant and assistance order was started on July 29, 2002. Both orders were stayed pending the determination of this application. <p>

ANALYSIS <p>

18.      The applicants challenge the validity of the search warrants on several grounds. The primary grounds are: <blockquote>

1.  There was insufficient evidence of a forgery; <p>
  
2.  The use of the general warrant and assistance order goes beyond what was intended by the Criminal Code; <p>
  
3.  The effect of the warrant is to reveal a privileged confidential source which violates a Charter protection. </blockquote>
  
Forgery <p>

19.      The evidence before Justice Khawly consisted of the Information to Obtain prepared by Corporal Gallant together with the exhibits. Corporal Gallant was cross-examined before me for several days. The applicants allege that there is insufficient evidence to show that a charge of forgery could be laid. <p>

20.      There were differences between the document sent to the National Post and the Bank''s document. A simple inspection of the Bank''s documents and the document sent to the National Post seems to show that writing was added. The name "Yvon Dumaime" appears on the upper left corner of the Bank''s document. It was later stated by Corporal Gallant that this was not a signature, but a note mistakenly made by a Bank employee. <p>

21.      The National Post requested a copy of the Hotel''s suppliers'' list to determine if JAC Consulting was owed money. The suppliers'' list omitted the page where JAC Consulting would have appeared alphabetically. This was not explained to Justice Khawly and should have been. However, I do not find the omission would denude the record of reasonable grounds to issue the warrant. <p>

22.      A serious question was raised about the integrity of the Bank''s files. However, I am not to substitute my views for that of the authorizing judge.  Based on the record, Justice Khawly had sufficient information to conclude the document was a forgery. <p>

23.      Suggestions were made about the good faith of the officer. I do not question his good faith or his approach to the pre-authorization process. Each step that he took has been subjected to microscopic scrutiny. In such a light, there are always matters that could, in retrospect have been differently done. I find that throughout, his conduct was respectful and professional. <p>

Use of the General Warrant and Assistance Order <p>

24.      The request to Justice Khawly was that he grant a general warrant and assistance order. This request was summarized by Corporal Gallant in the Information to Obtain as follows: <blockquote>

 I seek to engage in the following investigative procedure: to serve this warrant on the National Post Editor-in-Chief, to have an assistance order made to require him to cause the objects of seizure to be brought in safe condition to his offices, to subsequently re-attend at his offices to seize the things he has produced at that location and to then expose to those things to such forensic processes as may be appropriate. I propose that thereafter the usual terms and conditions governing media searches (noted below) apply to any object of seizure. </blockquote>
  
25.      The Crown alleges that this technique was necessary because the document had been moved by Mr. McIntosh to an undisclosed location. The applicants allege that this unprecedented use of the warrant and assistance order inverts the proper relationship between these two orders. <p>

26.      The applicants argue that the general warrant is really an anticipatory search warrant because the target of the search is not at the National Post at all. Thus, the preconditions to the issuance of a search warrant do not exist. The assistance order directs that the items be brought to the National Post thus effectively creating the condition that would justify the search. This, it is said, is not a legitimate use of the assistance order. <p>

27.      It is further argued that this combination of general warrant and assistance order expands the power to search dramatically because the police could forego establishing reasonable grounds to show the target of the search was at a location as long as they could identify someone to deliver it for seizure. The applicants have also argued that this novel use of the warrant and assistance order makes the editor of the newspaper an arm of the government. <p>

28.      Through sections 487.01 and 487.02 of the Criminal Code, Parliament has provided broad warrant granting power for any investigative techniques which can be brought within the Supreme Court of Canada''s conditions for judicial pre-authorization. Section 487.01(1) provides: <blockquote>

 A provincial court judge, a judge of a superior court of criminal jurisdiction or a judge as defined in section 552 may issue a warrant in writing authorizing a peace officer to, subject to this section, use any device or investigative technique or procedure or do any thing described in the warrant that would, if not authorized, constitute an unreasonable search or seizure in respect of a person or a person''s property if<blockquote>
  

(a)  the judge is satisfied by information on oath in writing that there are reasonable grounds to believe that an offence against this or any other Act of Parliament has been or will be committed and that information concerning the offence will be obtained through the use of the technique, procedure or device or the doing of the thing; </blockquote>
  
(b)  the judge is satisfied that it is in the best interests of the administration of justice to issue the warrant; and</blockquote>
  
(c)  there is no other provision in this or any other Act of Parliament that would provide for a warrant, authorization or order permitting the technique, procedure or device to be used or the thing to be done. </blockquote></blockquote>
  
29.      While there are a number of limits on the broad words of this section, it authorizes virtually any investigative technique. The purpose of the section is to allow the investigators "to unearth and preserve as much relevant evidence as possible." <p>

30.      The assistance order provision in section 487.02 provides: <blockquote>

 Where an authorization is given under section 184.2, 184.3, 186 or 188, a warrant is issued under this Act or an order is made under subsection 492.2(2), the judge or justice who gives the authorization, issues the warrant or makes the order may order any person to provide assistance, where the person''s assistance may reasonably be considered to be required to give effect to the authorization, warrant or order. </blockquote>
  
31.      The combination of a general warrant and assistance order was under consideration in Canadian Imperial Bank of Canada v. The Queen. There, Justice Ewaschuk upheld the warrant and assistance order which required the Bank to locate cheques and provide them to the police. <p>

32.      In Canada Post Corp. v. Canada (Attorney General) Justice O''Driscoll held that section 487.2 could properly be used to compel employees of Canada Post to locate and gather things, and give them to the police. <p>

33.      More recently, Justice LaForme held that ss. 487.01 and 487.02 can be used together to compel an unwilling non-target party to obtain things and produce them to the police for seizure. <p>

34.      Justice LaForme was considering an application by the Crown for a mandamus to require a provincial judge to exercise his jurisdiction to consider a warrant and assistance order similar to that issued by Justice Khawly here. The provincial judge had declined to issue the general warrant and assistance order holding they were not authorized by sections 487.01 and 487.02. Justice LaForme considered the "novel and creative use of" the sections and the lack of judicial authority directly on point. He concluded that s. 487.01 is remedial in its character and should not be narrowly construed. "Rather, it must be read with an appreciation for its purpose, namely, the enhancement of law enforcement and the protection of Charter values." He concluded that the ss. 487.01 and 487.02 can be used together to compel an unwilling non-target third party to obtain things and produce them to the police for seizure. <p>

35.      Justice LaForme found that the learned Justice was in error when he concluded that he did not have the jurisdiction to consider the application. He required the judge to reconsider the warrant application. <p>

36.      I agree in principle with the reasoning of Justice LaForme. The general warrant and assistance order can be used in combination to effectively require a third person to deliver items to police. However, there remains the issue, which is the primary one relied upon by the applicants: the effect of the warrants would cause the media to indirectly identify a confidential source. This issue was not considered by Justice LaForme and it is to that issue I now turn. Once the requirements of section 487 are met, that is not the end of the matter. There begins "a difficult and complex" process to determine if the warrant should be issued. <p>

Confidentiality <p>

37.      The fundamental attack on the general warrant and assistance order is constitutional. The applicants say that the proposed search and seizure are directed to the identification of a journalist''s confidential source. This, it is argued, violates freedom of expression guaranteed by the Charter. The media''s ability to effectively gather and disseminate news would be undermined if source confidentiality were not protected. <p>

38.      The Crown argues that the warrant and order are simple and unremarkable. The Crown seeks only real evidence of a serious offence and the media should not be allowed to expand the current law to create an unprecedented form of privilege. <p>

39.      These two positions summarize the important conflicting interests that must be balanced. The balancing, mandated by the Supreme Court of Canada, is neither simple nor unremarkable. It involves an examination of issues that go to the core values of our society. <p>

40.      The analysis will consider Charter guarantees and privilege in the context of a police investigation. <p>

The Charter <p>

41.      Even before the Charter, the importance of the protection of source confidentiality was recognized in the jurisprudence. Where the execution of a search warrant interferes with "rights as fundamental as freedom of the press" the justice of the peace exceeds jurisdiction ab initio. <p>

42.      Section 2(b) of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms guarantees the "freedom of thought, belief, opinion and expression, including freedom of the press and other media of communication." The importance of these freedoms has been recognized by the Supreme Court of Canada: <blockquote>

*  "It is difficult to imagine a guaranteed right more important to a democratic society than freedom of expression. Indeed a democracy cannot exist without that freedom to express new ideas and to put forward opinions about the functioning of public institutions." <p>
  
*  "The liberty to criticize and express dissentient views has long been thought to be a safeguard against state tyranny and corruption." <p>
  
*  Freedom of the press is "an important and essential attribute of a free and democratic society." </blockquote>

43      The activities protected by s. 2(b) include the gathering and dissemination of information. This freedom of expression given to the media "would be of little value if the freedom under s. 2(b) did not also encompass the right to gather news and information without undue governmental interference." <p>

44      Section 2(b) also encompasses the receipt of information by members of the public. Listeners and readers have a right to information pertaining to public institutions. It is only through the press that most individuals can learn of what is transpiring in government and come to their own assessment of the institution and its actions. By protecting the freedom of expression of the press, s. 2(b) thereby guarantees the further freedom of members of the public to develop, put forward and act upon informed opinions about government and other matters of public interest. <p>

45      It is because of the fundamental importance of a free press in a democratic society that special considerations arise in applications to search media premises or to seize material from journalists, pursuant to powers granted to the police under the Criminal Code. The effect of the search and seizure on the ability of the press to fulfill its function must be considered by the justice of the peace before issuing the order. Moreover, the overall reasonableness of the search is protected by s. 8 of the Charter. In this regard, the damaging effect of the search on the freedom and functioning of the press is highly relevant to the assessment of the reasonableness of the search. It is essential that flexibility in the balancing process be preserved so that all the factors relevant to the individual case may be taken into consideration and properly weighed. <p>

46      Here, there was much evidence filed which described the functioning of the press. Fifteen well-respected journalists swore affidavits. The evidence demonstrates that the use of confidential sources is essential to the uncovering and reporting of matters of public interest. <p>

47      Confidential sources were relied on in: <blockquote>

1.  The Watergate story which led to the resignation of President Richard Nixon. (Washington Post reporters Carl Bernstein and Bob Woodward relied extensively on anonymous sources, the most famous of whom became known as "Deep Throat.") <p>
  
2.  The tainted tuna scandal, that led to the resignation of the Minister of Fisheries in Canada. <p>
  
3.  The story that Airbus Industrie paid secret commissions in the sale of Airbus aircraft. <p>
  
4.  The book For Services Rendered about the search for a suspected KGB mole in the RCMP Security Service, and CBC''s the fifth estate program on that mole, code-named "Long Knife." <p>
  
5.  Stories dealing with the City of Toronto''s health inspection system for restaurants. <p>
  
6.  A story describing the operation of an illegal slaughterhouse in Vaughan. <p>
  
7.  Stories about the fall of Nortel Networks that contrasted optimistic public forecasts by Nortel executives with internal Nortel discussions warning of potential devastating market downturn. <p>
  
8.  Stories about wrongdoing by members of the RCMP security service in early 1977, including a break-in to obtain documents from a left-wing news agency in Montreal, Agence Presse Libre du Quebec, illegal wiretaps in Vancouver, pin-registers. <p>
  
9.  A story about a briefcase containing highly classified material that was stolen from the car of a CSIS intelligence agent. <p>
  
10.  The uncovering of US companies dumping hazardous waste in Canada because of lax environmental laws. </blockquote>
  
48      Inherent in the concept of confidentiality is the ability of the media to protect the identity of the source. The evidence establishes that sources may "dry-up" if their identities were revealed. Without confidential sources, many important stories of considerable public interest would not have been published. Confidential sources are essential to the effective functioning of the media in a free and democratic society. <p>

49      Sources want confidentiality for a variety of reasons. They may, themselves, be breaching a duty of confidentiality. They may have stolen the information. They may fear economic reprisals. They may lose their jobs. They may fear for their safety. They may fear for the safety of their families. <p>

50      The Crown argues that the actions of these sources should not be encouraged. I disagree. If employee confidentiality were to trump conscience, there would be a licence for corporations, governments and other employers to operate without accountability. Lord Denning stated that newspapers should not be compelled to disclose sources because: <blockquote>

 Their sources would dry up. Wrongdoing would not be disclosed. Charlatans would not be exposed. Unfairness would go unremedied. Misdeeds in the corridors of power, in companies or in government departments would never be known. </blockquote>

51      To compel a journalist to break a promise of confidentiality would do serious harm to the constitutionally entrenched right of the media to gather and disseminate information. The reasonableness of the search will be considered in the context of these Charter values. A Justice of the Peace considering a search warrant application must undertake a careful weighing of the privacy interests of individuals in a democratic society against the interest of the state investigating and prosecuting crimes. This weighing and balancing will vary with each case. The media are entitled to this "special consideration because of the importance of its role in a democratic society." <p>

52      Justice Cory''s often-quoted nine criteria for the granting of a warrant against the media include these comments: <blockquote>

*  The justice of the peace should ensure that a balance is struck between the competing interests of the state in the investigation and prosecution of crimes and the right to privacy of the media in the course of their news gathering and news dissemination. It must be borne in mind that the media play a vital role in the functioning of a democratic society. <p>
  
*  If, subsequent to the issuing of a search warrant, it comes to light the authorities failed to disclose pertinent information that could well have affected the decision to issue the warrant, this may result in a finding that the warrant was invalid. </blockquote>

53      In my view, the issuing justice did not have adequate information pertinent to the Charter issue. The warrants violate the Charter. In this case, the eroding of the ability of the press to perform its role in society cannot be outweighed by the Crown''s investigation. Mr. McIntosh is a well-respected journalist working for a major national newspaper on an important story. Society''s interest here, in protecting the confidentiality he promised, outweighs the benefits of disclosing the document. <p>

54      The issuing justice was not alive to these complex issues and thus not able to perform the balancing required. By proceeding on an ex parte basis, he precluded a complete analysis of the confidentiality issue. I find that he failed to give adequate consideration to the pertinent factor of confidential sources. This would have affected his decision to issue the warrant and results in a finding that the warrant was invalid and should not have been issued. <p>

Privilege <p>

55      The applicants claim that the documents received by the National Post are protected by the common law of privilege. The Crown contends that no privilege attaches because the documents are physical evidence of crime sent anonymously without a promise of confidentiality. <p>

56      The starting point for the consideration of privilege is that "everyone owes a general duty to give evidence relevant to the matter before the Court so that the truth may be ascertained."  Exceptions are permitted where the "public good" transcends this principle. Chief Justice McLachlin restated the test for consideration and referred to Wigmore''s four criteria: <blockquote>

 While the circumstances giving rise to a privilege were once thought to be fixed by categories defined in previous centuries ... it is now accepted that the common law permits privilege in new situations where reason, experience and application of the principles that underlie the traditional privileges so dictate ... <p>
  
 First, the communication must originate in a confidence. Second, the confidence must be essential to the relationship in which the communication arises. Third, the relationship must be one which should be "sedulously fostered" in the public good. Finally, if all these requirements are met, the court must consider whether the interests served by protecting the communications from disclosure outweigh the interest in getting at the truth and disposing correctly of the litigation. </blockquote>

57      Rules of privilege by their very nature, work at cross-purposes to the quest for the truth. They are therefore strictly construed and recognized only where there are important social values implicated. <p>

58      The law of privilege "may evolve to reflect the social and legal realities of our time." This statement was made in the context of victims of sexual abuse. The reality here is no less socially significant. We are concerned with the media''s ability to gather news so that the public is informed. <p>

59      The Wigmore criteria operate to guide the evolution of privilege which must reflect the social and legal context of our time. That context includes the possibility of sophisticated DNA testing to establish identity and the increasingly important role of the press. <p>

60      The consideration of privilege must start with an analysis of the relationship in question. The relationship here, while not protected by a class privilege, is one that may, on a case-by-case basis, be protected. Examples of such relationships include "doctor-patient, psychologist-patient, journalist-informant and religious communications." <p>

61      The importance of the journalist-informant relationship is established by the evidence. If the journalist-informant relationship is undermined, society as a whole is affected. It is through confidential sources that matters of great public importance are made known. As corporate and public power increase, the ability of the average citizen to affect his or her world depends upon the information disseminated by the press. To deprive the media of an important tool in the gathering of news would affect society as a whole. The relationship is one that should be fostered. <p>

62      The Wigmore criteria are not "carved in stone". Rather, they "provide a general framework within which policy considerations and the requirements of fact-finding can be weighed and balanced on the basis of their relative importance in the particular case before the court."  This is understandable since they were formulated in a social context different from ours. Also, they are meant to apply to a wide variety of circumstances and may require modification depending upon the nature of the relationship involved. <p>

63      Justice Major, in referring to the possibility of a journalist-informant privilege forecast the broadening scope of the first Wigmore criterion. The nature of the privilege is with respect to the identity of the informant, not the content of the communication. Indeed, the relationship is entered into precisely so that some communications be made public. The confidentiality relates to the source of the information and any information that may tend to reveal it. <p>

64      It is clear on principle and on authority that what is protected is the identity of the informant. In a libel action the so called "newspaper rule" has protected documents from disclosure which would reveal a confidential source. <p>

65      The first criterion requires that the communication originated in a confidence that the communication would not be disclosed. The Crown states this requirement has not been met. The Crown asserts that the document came from an anonymous source in a brown envelope. Thus, no expectation of confidentiality could arise. It is suggested that the promises of confidentiality given to X before and after the receipt of the document cannot cloak the anonymous delivery with an expectation of privacy. Also, physical evidence is not privileged. <p>

66      This is, with respect, too narrow a view. The receipt of the document cannot be considered in isolation. Rather it was part of an ongoing relationship. It was a relationship founded upon an expectation of confidentiality. It was in the expectation of that confidentiality that X revealed he/she was the source of the document. The identity of the source of the document should be protected. If this identity is privileged, then to allow production of a document that would effectively negate the privilege, makes no sense. <p>

67      The applicants compare the situation to that of the police informers. While they are protected by a class privilege (which is not the case here) the nature of the privilege is analogous. As stated by Cory J.A. (as he then was): <blockquote>

 It was also obvious to the courts from very early times that the identity of an informer would have to be concealed, both for his or her own protection and to encourage other to divulge to the authorities any information pertaining to crimes. </blockquote>

68      As recently stated by the House of Lords in relation to journalists'' confidential sources: <blockquote>

 ... if the identity of (police) informers were too readily liable to be disclosed in a court of law the sources of information would dry up and the police would be hindered in their duty of preventing and detecting crime. Ordering journalists to disclose their sources can have similar consequences. The fact is that information which should be placed in the public domain is frequently made available to the press by individuals who would lack the courage to provide the information if they thought there was a risk of their identity being disclosed. The fact that journalists'' sources can be reasonably confident that their identity will not be disclosed makes a significant contribution to the ability of the press to perform their role in society of making information available to the public. It is for this reason that it is well established now that the courts will normally protect journalists'' sources from identification. </blockquote>

69      The Crown resists this analogy, referring to one author who stated: </blockquote>

 Are these arguments equally valid in connection with media sources? The role of the media with society is quite distinct from that of the police. It follows that a distinction must be drawn between those who inform to the media, and those who assist in law enforcement. The police informer privilege is designed to further the public interest in the effective investigation and prosecution of criminal offences. A privilege attaching to media sources would advance different interests, and might ultimately hinder effective law enforcement, by barring disclosure of information which is required for full police or judicial inquiry into alleged crimes. In other words, the public interest in maintaining a free and independent press, while important, will not always supersede other compelling societal interests. As held by the United States Supreme Court in Branzburg v. Hayes, it is not necessarily better to write about crime than to prosecute it. </blockquote>

70      This position underscores the complexity of the analysis and the difficulty of balancing the interests when matters of grave public interest are engaged. The same author stated, later: <blockquote>

 Finally, it is apparent that the nature of the relationship between a reporter and his or her source is not unique within Canadian society. There are any number of important professional relationships which are premised upon an underlying expectation of confidentiality. Consider, for example, the relationships between priest and penitent, and therapist and patient. It might equally be argued in these contexts that the threat of disclosure inhibits the free and frank exchange necessary for the relationships to achieve their objects. Moreover, at least within the religious sphere, a constitutional dimension might be injected by virtue of section 2(a) of the Charter. Yet, neither a confession offered to a priest, nor a highly intimate disclosure offered to a therapist, is presumptively protected by privilege. Viewed against this backdrop, it becomes difficult to justify extension of the privilege doctrine to communications between reporters and their sources. </blockquote>
  
71      I agree with the author up to the last quoted sentence. The fact that there is no presumption and the fact that other relationships may adopt the argument, are not reasons to avoid the difficult balancing of interests. These factors merely highlight the need for an in depth case by case considerations of the respective interests involved. The costs of disclosure in light of the injury to the relationship must be weighed. As one commentator stated in connection with a religious communication: "... the balancer must take into account the long-term effects of disclosure on the practice of religion and the benefits the community derives from clergy''s contributions to the health of many citizens." <p>

72      Viewed in this context, Wigmore''s first test is met. The communication and the document are inextricably tied together. To disclose the document, would be to negate the confidence. Sopinka, Lederman and Bryant in discussing the distinction between fact and communication highlighted the risk of indirectly eroding the privilege: "The distinction between "fact" and "communication" is often a difficult one and the courts should be wary of drawing the line too fine lest the privilege be seriously emasculated." (Emphasis added) <p>

73      The Courts have, in other contexts, applied this approach so as not to undermine a privilege. McLachlin J. (as she then was) referred to Cory J.A.''s police informant analogy and stated that, in connection with police informants, privilege: <blockquote>

 ... prevents not only disclosure of the name of the informant, but of any information which might implicitly reveal his or her identity. Courts have acknowledged that the smallest details may be sufficient to reveal identity. </blockquote>

74      I conclude that the identity of the source was given pursuant to a promise of confidentiality. This communication arose in confidence and is privileged. Disclosure of the document would negate that privilege. The first Wigmore criterion is met. <p> 
75      I turn to the second and third Wigmore criteria. Clearly in light of the comments throughout, the element of confidentiality is essential to the maintenance of the relationship and is one which the community wishes to sedulously foster. The public relies on the watchdog role of the press to be informed about their political leaders. <p>

76      The fourth requirement is that the interests served by protecting the communications from disclosure outweigh the interest of pursuing the truth and disposing correctly of the litigation. It is an analysis that must be infused with Charter values. <p>

77      Freedom of expression is a cornerstone of our society. The ability of the public to know what its elected leaders are doing is fundamental to a democracy. We rely on the news media to provide us with this information. The expectation that a source will remain confidential is often the very reason people feel free to go to the press. Often the more explosive the story is, the greater the risk to the informant if he or she is exposed. Reputations, livelihoods and security may be at stake. Without confidentiality the press would not receive some information. Protection of the confidentiality serves the interests of the informant. In serving the interests of the informant, the interests of society are served to an even greater degree. <p>

78      The Wigmore criteria, applied to this case, demonstrate an overwhelming interest in protecting the identity of Mr. McIntosh''s source. But more is required. It must also be demonstrated that the benefit that inures from privilege outweighs the interest in the correct disposal of the litigation. As Chief Justice McLachlin stated, this exercise is "essentially one of common sense and good judgement." <p>

79      The balancing of these competing interests leads me to confirm the privilege. Here, the document is required as part of an investigation, not the defence of an accused. There is evidence that the document was probably extensively handled. There is only a remote and speculative possibility that the fingerprints were those of the alleged forgerer. Disclosure of the document will minimally, if at all, advance the investigation while at the same time damage freedom of expression. <p>

80      There are unique factors here, including, the confidential relationship between X and Mr. McIntosh: the fact that he/she was promised confidentiality; the politically charged nature of the information obtained; the importance of informing Canadians with respect to the most powerful political figure in the country; and the vast body of evidence and jurisprudence produced which show the importance of confidentiality in the news gathering role of the press. All these factors outweigh the benefits of disclosure in the context of this investigation. <p>

81      Insofar as the documents may reveal the confidential identity of a source, they are privileged. <p>

82      I have been urged to develop guidelines for the production of journalistic information. This would be contrary to the approach which I believe is mandated by the law: a case-by-case balancing of respective interests. <p>

83      The issuing justice was required to ensure that there was a sufficient evidentiary basis before him upon which he could exercise his discretion. The issuing justice failed to give adequate consideration to the pertinent issue of confidentiality because adequate information was not before him. This had to affect the decision to issue the warrant and results in a finding that the warrant is invalid and should not have been issued. <p>

84      The applicants requested several times of the Crown and the police that they be provided with notice so that they could attend before the issuing justice. In proceeding ex parte, the issuing justice precluded a thorough analysis of the significant constitutional issues raised. Given the public interest at stake, this is one of the rare instances where failure on the part of the justice to give notice amounts to a jurisdictional error. <p>

85      The unique circumstances here required a balancing of interests that could not take place in the absence of the applicants. The justice could therefore not strike a justifiable balance between the interest of the State, the target of the search and society at large. <p>

Conclusion <p>

86      The application is about confidentiality. No other case in Canada involves a search warrant coupled with an assistance order aimed at identifying a journalist''s confidential source. <p>

87      The matter requires a balancing of the important completing societal interests: freedom of expression and investigation of crime. It involves an analysis of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms and the common law of privilege. These issues were not fully considered by issuing justice. He was therefore deprived of jurisdiction. <p>

88      The application is allowed and the general warrant and assistance order are quashed. <p>

89      The issue of costs remains outstanding. Counsel should let me know convenient dates for argument of this issue. <p>

CHARLOTTETOWN  &#8212;  A moonlighting minister is taking some heat over using his government car to get to his second job. Tourism minister Phillip Brown helps his wife clean post offices in the westrn end of Prince Edward Island.<p>

Oppostion member Ron MacKinley brought the issue to the floor of Province House on Wednesday.<p>

He told the house the Liberal office has been getting phone calls from people who see Brown driving to his second job with his taxpayer funded vehicle.<p>

MacKinley went straight to the point. " A question to the minister of tourism," he told the house. "Last week were you cleaning the post office up in your own area?"<p>

"I was mopping the floor at the post office in Wellington," responded a clearly uncomfortable Brown.<p>

The tourism minister said he and his wife have held the cleaning contracts for years.<p>

When MacKinley refused to relent, Brown became upset.<p>

"This is a personal situation," he said. "And I''m quite taken aback that the member thinks this is some kind of issue that he wants to bring to the floor of the legislature."<p>

"He doesn''t understand it, he''s been at the trough so long," countered MacKinley. "The question is why would he have the government car there? "You''re the minister, why take the government car to do this work?"<p>

WebPosted Thu Apr 22 13:39:18 2004<p> 
CBC SPORTS ONLINE - Jacques Martin''s nine-year tenure as head coach of the Ottawa Senators is over. <p>

The Senators fired their long-time bench boss Thursday, three days after the Sens made a first-round playoff exit, losing to the Toronto Maple Leafs in seven games. <p>

It marked the fourth time in five seasons the Sens have been eliminated by their Ontario rivals. <p>

"We''re announcing today we''re replacing Jacques Martin as head coach of the team," Senators general manager John Muckler told a news conference at the Corel Centre in Ottawa. <p>

Assistant coach Don Jackson and goaltending coach Phil Myre were also fired. Perry Pearn, another assistant, was not let go. He is still under contract, but Muckler said he will not be a candidate for the head coaching job. <p>

"In order to take the next step, towards winning a Stanley Cup, we must select a new face, a new voice with a fresh approach and with new ideas," Muckler said. <p>

The Ottawa GM said he would begin the search for a replacement immediately, but that the Sens were in rush to name Martin''s successor. <p>

Muckler said he wants to find the best candidate and one who will "fix" the culture in the Sens dressing room and find and develop more leadership. <p>

Martin was the NHL''s coach of the year in 1998-99 and was a finalist for the award three other times. <p>

He was given a two-year contract extension in January with a club option for a third in case of a lockout next season. <p>

Though Martin helped Ottawa become one of the NHL''s top teams, the Sens managed to win just four of 12 playoff series during his tenure. <p>

The Sens won the Presidents'' Trophy as the NHL''s top team in the regular season in 2002-03 and reached the conference final for the first time in team history where they lost to eventual Stanley Cup winners New Jersey in seven games. <p>

After the success of last season, expectations for the Senators were high this year. The team had new ownership under businessman Eugene Melnyk. Team captain Daniel Alfredsson even guaranteed the team would win the Stanley Cup. <p>

Government Announces Plans for Crack Cocaine Sales
Faced with mounting deficits, and light traffic at the betting windows of Island race tracks, Provincial Treasurer Mitch Murphy today announced plans to begin selling crack cocaine in Summerside and Charlottetown.<p>

"The additional revenue that crack sales provides will allow us to significantly improve the infrastructure at the Charlottetown Driving Park and Summerside Raceway," Murphy said on the steps of the Legislative Assembly.<p>


While critics say that the sale of crack cocaine, which they claim is a powerfully reinforcing psychostimulant, will lead to social and health problems, Murphy dismisses these complaints. "Crack is in widespread use in major cities across North America," Murphy said, "and it would be irresponsible of us not to tap into the potential new revenue source."<p>


Using funds from the sales of crack, the grandstand of the Charlottetown Driving Park will be rebuilt, a new restaurant and lounge will be constructed, and an underground network of 200 specially constructed "crack dens" will be housed in the area under the grandstand. "Crack users have been crying out for a central, clean, well-lighted place to practise their craft; we''re simply answering that call," explained Murphy.<p>


Construction of the crack facilty is expected to start after Old Home Week in August, with the crack fully available in early 2005. <p>', '2004-05-17 18:25:31', '2008-06-12 14:46:57.72057', 0, true, false, true, 'soontobedeleted', false);

Women fighting use of Islamic law </h4><p>
But backers say rights protected<p>


By LYNDA HURST, FEATURE WRITER<p>

Had she stayed in Iran, Homa Arjomand would now be dead.<p>

All &#8212; all &#8212; of the women''s activists she worked with in Tehran have been executed, victims of a reactionary regime that ruled, and continues to rule, by strict adherence to Islam''s sharia law.<p>

In 1989, she and her husband paid $15,000 to smugglers to help them and their two young children flee the country. For three days, they rode on horseback through the mountains, sleeping in barns before finally reaching Turkey.
Two years later, the onetime professor of medical physics arrived in Canada as a refugee. And how grateful she was to be in a secular country, where female equality was the law.<p>

That was then.<p>

Last fall, Arjomand, now a transitional counsellor in Toronto for immigrant women, heard the province had quietly approved the use of Islamic law in Ontario''s Muslim community.  A group she''d never heard of, called the Islamic Institute of Civil Justice, had gained the right to hold tribunals, darul qada, in which marriage, family and business disputes can be settled according to sharia.  The 1,300-year-old body of laws and rules for living was inspired by the Qur''an, Islam''s holy book.  Arjomand was horrified.<p>

"The last thing I expected in Canada, the last thing I want, is sharia law," she says. "Women are not equal under it, therefore it is opposed to Canada''s laws and values. The government can''t let this happen."<p>

The government has no intention of stopping it.<p>

Muslims can''t be excluded from Ontario''s 1991 Arbitration Act, which allows religious groups to resolve family disputes, says the attorney-general''s office. Hassidic Jews have been running their own Beit Din arbitrations based on Jewish law for years. Catholics, too, even Ismaili Muslims. Rulings are binding, but must be consistent with Canadian laws and the Charter of Rights.<p>

"There are safeguards built into the act," says Brendan Crawley, the attorney-general''s spokesperson, who has been fielding calls from the world''s press on the unprecedented decision.<p>

"Participation must be voluntary by both parties and there is recourse if a decision doesn''t abide by Canadian law. They can appeal to the courts."<p>

Arjomand has heard all this and doesn''t buy a word of it.  Now head of the new International Campaign To Stop Sharia Courts in Canada, she and representatives from several concerned groups met last month with senior staff at the attorney-general''s office and with Sandra Pupatello, the minister responsible for women''s issues.  Arjomand told them flatly that under the guise of protecting religious freedom and multiculturalism &#8212; the fear, perhaps, of offending the Muslim community''s male leadership &#8212; they were about to let the rights of Canadian Muslim women be trampled on. 

Most at risk are young immigrants, said Arjomand, who come from the Middle East or North Africa, where sharia is the law and has been used to subjugate them their entire lives. They know nothing different.   Now that sharia tribunals are to operate here, she says, many women will be socially and psychologically coerced into participating. To refuse would mean rejection by their families and the community &#8212; or worse.<p>

"In a straight disagreement between a husband and wife, the husband''s testimony will prevail. That is sharia. Even those women who know they can appeal will not challenge an arbitration decision for fear of the consequences."<p>

Despite what the attorney-general''s office blithely assumes, she says, it''s unlikely decisions contrary to Canadian law will ever show up before the courts.<p>

Sharia-approved but illegal activities already occur in Toronto, and she fears this will give strength to them. Muslim women are battered but don''t dare report it. Bigamous marriages occur. Among her clients are two 14-year-old girls who were married last year to older men, in defiance of Ontario law prohibiting marriage before age 16.<p>

"This is child abuse, sexual abuse," Arjomand says scathingly. "These girls were born in Canada. I want to tell them to leave and get them into group homes, but if they do they''ll be disavowed and isolated."<p>

In a May 7 letter to Arjomand, John Gregory, general counsel to the attorney-general, acknowledged "the oppression that some Muslim women experience in Canada."<p>

But that was not reason to deny the Islamic Institute the right to use the Arbitration Act.  "The family or community pressure that prevents (a woman) from going to court to dispute an arbitration seems likely to prevent her from going to court to assert her legal rights even without an arbitration."<p>

Moreover, he added, "you may be asking us to find a legal remedy for what is mainly a cultural or possibly religious problem. So far it is not clear to us what legal remedy would be effective and constitutional."<p>

Arjomand is now meeting with lawyers to see if they can find a remedy. A campaign Web site petition to halt the tribunals before they begin has already collected 2,056 names.<p>

Alia Hogben, Indian-born president of the Canadian Council of Muslim Women, says she got the same "nothing we can do" response after meeting with Gregory. And a council letter to Premier Dalton McGuinty was "sloughed off."<p>

"We''ve consulted scholars and they tell us we can''t accept this," says the retired social worker. "Everyone in the world is looking at Canada. A precedent can''t be set. We can''t give in."<p>

Hogben dismisses the province''s claim that Ismaili Muslims (followers of the Aga Khan) have used private arbitration for years without problem and therefore why shouldn''t the rest of the community. As she dryly points out, "Ismailis don''t use the sharia in their arbitrations."<p>

The women''s council''s 900 members come from all Islamic sects: Shia, Sunni, Sufi, Wahhabi, Somali and Ismaili. "It is difficult for us to speak out because we are practising, pro-faith Muslims who don''t want to provide ammunition to those who malign Islam."<p>

But they feel they must, she says, because the equality of the sexes espoused by the Qur''an is not reflected in the sharia &#8212; the laws that evolved over 200 years following the death of Mohammad in 632 AD.<p>

"We see this as a women''s equality issue," Hogben says. "Women are afraid they will not be `good'' Muslims if they don''t go along with it or that they''ll be accused of blasphemy. Why, why is it happening?"  She answers her own question with another question: "Is it because the government doesn''t want to be seen as anti-Muslim? But this is anti-women. Why should we be treated differently from other Canadian women?"<p>

The international rights group Women Living Under Muslim Laws has warned that secular states like Canada must be careful not to fall into the trap of not interfering in old-world traditions out of misguided sensitivity. Trying to avoid discrimination against a whole group, it says, can lead to discrimination against its female members.  Like Arjomand, Hogben resents the contention of the Islamic Institute of Civil Justice and its head, Mumtaz Ali, that sharia arbitrations are an expression of Canada''s multicultural ethos.<p>

"It''s a false argument," she says. "Multiculturalism was never meant to take away the equality rights of a group, in this case Muslim women."<p>

Adeena Niazi, executive director of the Afghan Women''s Organization, is "in between" on the issue. If it''s applied correctly, Islamic law will be of benefit to women, she says, "but there has always been misinterpretation and misuse under the sharia, and women deprived of their rights."  Niazi grew up in an Afghanistan that had an Islamic constitution in which women were educated and had careers. Only when the warlords and ultimately the Taliban seized power, she says, were sharia laws used to persecute women. She fled in 1988.<p>

The majority of Canada''s 600,000 Muslims &#8212; more than half live in Ontario &#8212; are recent arrivals. Niazi says they often don''t speak the language, don''t know the laws, certainly know nothing about equal rights.<p>

"We see women who are beaten and who take it because they are afraid of the community. That''s the reality."<p>

Many in the Muslim community, men included, don''t see how the arbitration tribunals can possibly work. Sharia differs among various sects and countries of origin. An interpretation in one country is unacceptable in another. In 2002, many Muslims around the world were outraged, for instance, when a Nigerian sharia court sentenced a woman found guilty of adultery to be stoned to death. After a global protest, the Nigerian high court overturned the ruling. <p>

"Which model will be used?" asks a male critic, Mubin Shaikh. "There is too much division in the community for this to work. Sharia is complex. Wahhabis Muslims won''t go to a Sunni arbitrator and so on."<p>

The whole contentious idea of private sharia courts belongs to Mumtaz Ali, a retired Indian-born lawyer, president of the Canadian Society of Muslims and founder of the Islamic Institute of Civil Justice.<p>

Ali has been working since 1991 to find a way for Muslims to fully practise their faith in secular Canada, to be able to follow the sharia, which is required if they are to be devout.<p>

"Living by religious law is our whole life," he says. In facilitating that, "the Ontario government is the most enlightened in the world. This is the multiculturalism of my friend Pierre Trudeau." <p>

The existence of sects with varying interpretations of Islamic law isn''t a concern because the model to be used is a "Canadianized sharia," he says.<p>

"It will be a watered-down sharia, not 100 per cent sharia. Only those provisions that agree with Canadian laws will be used. If there is a conflict between the two, Canadian law will prevail."<p>

(To critics, his remarks are confusingly at odds with an article written for the Calgary Herald in January by Syed Soharwardy, a founding member of the Islamic Institute, in which he wrote: "Sharia cannot be customized for specific countries. These universal, divine laws are for all people of all countries for all times.")<p>

Yes, Ali is aware that many Muslim women fear females will not be treated equally. They are wrong, he says: "That issue will not arise."<p>

He thinks they''re afraid because they don''t understand how the tribunals will work; indeed, few people do because details haven''t been released.<p>

Ali says there will usually be two arbitrators hearing a dispute; one an expert on Canadian marriage, divorce and family laws, the other a sharia expert. If necessary, a third will act as umpire. They all will have access to a raft of Islamic scholars.<p>

Initially, arbitrators will come from a panel of about 15 lay people, not all of whom will be Muslim. One, he says, is a retired Ontario judge and non-Muslim. Few imams will be used, however, because "they are not qualified academically."<p>

Most will have taken a course on the arbitration process (which differs from mediation, in which parties reach their own agreement). Ali says this training accounts for the delay in getting the tribunals going. <p>

Husbands and wives will each have their own lawyer in attendance, he stresses, and arbitrators will be duty-bound to ensure no party is being pressured to take part or to accept a ruling. <p>

In any event, "that does not happen here," he says. "It happens in Egypt, in other countries, but not Canada. No one will be pressured. People think we''re bringing in Taliban law. Not so. No one is going to be stoned to death or have their hands cut off."<p>

As he notes, "the Charter of Rights doesn''t allow for cruel and unusual punishment."  After speaking to a Muslim women''s group in Edmonton this week, Ali was asked why women should go near a sharia arbitration when their rights are covered by Canadian courts. "To be a good Muslim you must," he told them.<p>

But it is also in women''s own interests, he says. Just as Canadian law allows for prenuptial agreements, sharia offers marriage contracts. As an example, he says a woman could ask for the right of divorce &#8212; normally belonging only to men &#8212; to be transferred to her. Sharia also provides for her dowry to be returned to her.<p>

Critics are welcome to monitor any arbitration &#8212; appearing as "a friend of the court" &#8212; if they think the rights of women will be violated, he adds.<p>

This will come as news to the Council of Muslim Women, which was not informed that the arbitration tribunals were in the works, not asked for its views, nor to make recommendations. As far as it knows, the arbitrations will be private.<p>

"It would have been in Mumtaz Ali''s interest to consult women''s groups," says Annie Bunting, director of York University''s law and society department. <p>

"Yes, Canadian laws will trump the sharia, on the books at least. But what impact will these tribunals have on women''s lives?"<p>

That''s the question being asked by Muslim women living in Canada a decade or more. A Halifax woman called Alia Hogben to say that if the tribunals come to pass, she will no longer consider herself a Muslim.<p>

Homa Arjomand no longer does, not after what happened to the women of Iran &#8212; and almost to her &#8212; under its draconian regime. She believes passionately that state and religion must be kept separate despite Canada''s well-intentioned allegiance to multiculturalism.<p>

It was a mad idea: Visit the world''s five best clam houses -- in Essex, Mass., the birthplace of the fried clam - in under two hours. It would be like going to Perigord and consuming every variation of foie gras in half an afternoon. But National Newspaper Award winner IAN BROWN takes up the liver-challenging quest.<p>
Saturday, June 12, 2004 - Page T1<p> 
Let me begin by saying that I thought of writing a children''s book about a fried clam. The title was going to be Flim-Flam, the Good Fried Clam. The plot was even more of a problem. Umberto Eco, the Italian postmodernist, once remarked (although Virginia Woolf said the same thing 70 years earlier) that we read stories to experience the thrill of the inevitable: to strap ourselves into the life of a character as if the character were a roller coaster, which then goes screaming down the heart-stopping track of life inescapably until it bumps to a stop at the end. But my attempts to bring Flim-Flam the Clam to life on dry paper taught me that a story can be too inevitable.<p>

However the tale started out -- Flam the Clam gets scooped up by a sailor and sees the world, Flam meets a tourist on the beach and is taken back to the cottage for dinner, Flam runs away from his mud-flat home to the city, where he is befriended by a Chinese chef -- it (inevitably) ended with Flam being fried. Because Flam is a clam. And if Flam is a clam, he must be fried -- because as Virginia Woolf also said, a good story makes you feel it can happen only one way. And once fried, he must also be eaten, as it is not believable within the frame of human reference that a fried clam can exist and not be consumed.<p>

So Flam got on the sailboat and even saw Madagascar -- but then he was fried and eaten. He made friends with the tourist''s little girl who really -- ah, but then he was fried and eaten. He learned Mandarin while living in a tank for weeks and customers loved him and gave him a name, but . . . yes, delicious clam, he was eaten.<p>

And really, how much of a story is that? Better just to fry the little bastard, and consume him -- and possibly his brothers and sisters and extended family as well.<p>

Here is another clam-related experience you should not attempt: You should not decide to drive from Boston to New Hampshire for the weekend, and in the course of passing through Essex on Cape Ann an hour north of Boston, the birthplace of the fried clam and still home to its finest exemplification, listen to your brother Tim, an equally enthusiastic clam consumer, say, "You know, we should stop and eat clams on the drive back, and try to find the best clam place in Essex," only to depart far too late the following day, thereby leaving yourselves a mere two hours to visit the five finest clam stands in the Western world.<p>

You should not do this because you will try to visit all the clam stands anyway, which would be like going to Perigord and consuming every known variation of foie gras in half an afternoon. It would be bad for your health.<p>

We decided to clam ahead. We have always liked travelling and talking and eating, my brother and I; when we aren''t talking, we tend to be eating, or thinking about eating. You might be tempted to suggest that this is a substitute for intimacy, but you would be mistaken.<p>

My brother and I have never had trouble talking about intimate things, provided we''re tucking into a lobster roll, or a double-smoked hickory bacon and avocado BLT, or maybe a shrimp, mango and dill mayonnaise rollup.<p>

Then there''s the ultimate intimate brotherly thrill -- talking about eating while eating, preferably clams.<p>

At this point, a brief digression is required to discuss the clam qua clam, as Samuel Beckett would have said. Clams are bivalves -- mollusks, if you must -- that burrow under the sea floor.<p>

While there are more than 15,000 species of clam -- the biggest, the aptly named giant clam, Tridacna gigas, can be 1.5 metres long and weigh as much as five table dancers -- the species we are most concerned with here is the Ipswich clam.<p>

The Ipswich is a soft-shell clam found in the mud flats of the Essex River. The Essex is a tidal estuary in Essex Bay, which in turn is part of the 7,000-hectare Great Marsh that riddles the Massachusetts coast all the way to New Hampshire. The lucky clams of Essex Bay can use their tube-like necks, or siphons, to suck in tiny fresh plankton with every flowing tide, twice a day. <p>

Ipswich clams (like clams from Sagadahoc Bay and the Damariscotta River in Maine, which many Essex clammeries use to augment their supply of local mudders) are thus especially fresh, but also "muddy" to the tongue. Disgusting as this sounds, it isn''t; the briny taste gives Ipswich fried clams the sour tang that underlies the sweetness of their soft, fried flesh, a knockout one-two combo.<p>

No one''s disparaging spaghetti alle vongole, mind you, or a big bowl of steamers with butter at Rodney''s in Toronto, or the chowder at the Oyster Bar in the basement of Grand Central Station. They''re all delicious. But fried Ipswich clams are the truffles of the sea.<p>

And so, one Sunday afternoon in the spring, as the sun began its decline over western Massachusetts and the liquid granite vapour of the Atlantic rushed into our nostrils from the east, as the lust for clams began to replace our capacity to create metaphor, my dear brother and I set out on our noble, liver-challenging experiment: to eat fried clams from five of the world''s best clam eateries, all before they closed in two hours time.<p>

Did I mention my brother and I are systems guys? All the way down from New Hampshire, shortly after we stopped for midafternoon barbecued pork sandwiches at the Yankee Smokehouse in West Ossipee and well before we hit the first mudder hut in Ipswich, we developed a glitch-free eat-and-run plan.<p>

To save time, while one of us parked the car, the other would run into the clam spot and order a "small box." (This is the traditional Yankee clam-ordering phrase. Clams in Essex come in white cardboard boxes, not unlike take-out Chinese food cartons. They are beautiful things.) Meanwhile the parker, having parked the car, would collect ketchup, tartar sauce (preferably home-made according to secret recipe), lemon juice, vinegar, napkins and water, by which time the order man would have paid for the clams. We would then retreat to the car and eat as many clams as we wanted (that is, as many as we could) before starting the car and racing to the next spot, still eating.<p>

We also devised a morphological chart that let us, with a minimum of effort, rate and record in standardized fashion the fried clam-scarfing experience at each clam house (see chart). This was crucial, knowing as we did that the capacity to retain data diminishes in direct proportion to fried-clam ingestion.<p>

All of these antics occurred while driving Route 133 between Ipswich and Essex, Mass., where five of the best fried clammeries in the entire universe are arrayed like . . . like . . . like fine lovers in a lucky past . . . like shrines on a pilgrim''s pathway . . . like dreams in a night of sleep. . . .In any event, they''re about three minutes apart, on average.<p>

You know you''ve arrived at the gates of clam heaven when you see the Clam Box on the south side of the road in Ipswich. The Clam Box, a small grey structure in the shape of an open clam box, offers plenty of parking and a serious devotion to frying seafood. A few years ago, it was judged best North Shore seafood spot by Gourmet magazine. Of course, ratings are for idiots: When in Clamville, as Heraclitus said in a completely different context, one must judge for oneself. <p>

The Clam Box has plenty of charms. You can smell the fried-clam smell, the Chanel No. 22 of the sea, from the parking lot. There''s a sign on the door that says, "We will be changing our oil at approximately 2:30 today. This will take about 15-20 minutes. We apologize for the delay and for any inconvenience." For a serious clam eater, 20 minutes is a holdup of Tantric proportions.<p>

The Clam Box is not fancy, but like most New England Yankee things, it is decent: The restaurant insists on shirts and shoes. Owner Marina (Chickie) Aggelakis (her father started the nearby Agawam Diner in Rowley, which is well worth a visit), likes to douse her freshly shucked clams in evaporated milk before they''re dredged in finely ground corn meal and plunged into a vat of boiling lard for 30 seconds, to roil off excess breading. They''re then replunged into a second vat of seething lard. We found 40 clams in a small box, and we''d eaten half of them by the time we got to The Village Restaurant, clam spot No. 2, a short drive down the road into Essex.<p>

"How do you like them?" I said to Tim, in what was already, by now, a rare outburst. "I can''t stop eating them," he said. Which was quite obvious: I only asked to distract him, so I could grab a few fried necks of my own.<p>

The Village Restaurant will let you order clams to carry, but it occupies the opposite end of the fried-clam-eating hierarchy, as a sit-down restaurant. This is a lovely idea, though the prospect of getting a table and waiting for a server to come by and then deliver the clams -- on a plate, no less! -- might be a serious challenge for the clam-deprived, which we still considered ourselves.<p>

Fortunately the owners, brothers Mark and Kevin Ricci, whose family opened The Village Restaurant in 1956, do fast and brilliant take-out as well. If there is a golden-standard for fried clams, the Village''s fare is it: crisp, light, succulent, and as delicious at the bottom of the box as they were at the top. <p>

We performed our unpatented park-eat-drive-rate routine. Five minutes later we were on the road again. The Village fryers were so good -- the best of the lot, as it turned out -- that this time we ate the entire box of 24. By now, two-fifths of the way into our quest, we had each consumed two dozen deep-fried invertebrates. <p>

Whereupon we arrived at Woodman''s. Woodman''s is a wood-plank roadside emporium hard by the Essex mud flats, and always has been: It was here, on the morning of July 3, 1916, at the suggestion of a local fisherman trying to sell excess supply, that Lawrence (Chubby) Woodman, a potato chip maker, invented the fried clam. (Judging from his and even Mrs. Woodman''s size in later years, the great event didn''t occur a moment too soon.)<p>

Woodman''s is the biggest of Essex''s generally smallish clam spots, the most clamant and atmospheric. It also serves the largest Ipswich clams, which some clamists consider too big, "except for people from Connecticut." (I have no idea what that means.)<p>

In any event, that was another 18 basted bivalves. I feel impelled here to say that it doesn''t take long to eat a fried clam. There''s the initial burst of fried fat flavour on the tongue; the contemporaneous crunch of the fried bits and the delicate burst of the sea-fed tendon; the gluttonous, guilty, gulping swallow; the autonomic reach for another, the brief mourning upon reaching the bottom of the box and finding no more. Like so many other things -- the Belmont, Pomp and Circumstance, the short stories of Dovlatov -- it''s always over faster than you''d like. <p>

It was only then, back in the car, steadying myself for the now dusky race to clam spot No. 4, that I noticed I didn''t . . . feel terribly well. Nothing to stop me from eating on, mind you . . . but small spots had begun to appear before my eyes. The only place I''d read about such symptoms was in Archie comics, when Archie overdid it at Pops'' Diner on hamburgers. The spots I saw were smaller than clams, but they made me want to lie down.<p>

My brother, who eats fried clams all the time, felt better by comparison: He was a little green, and a Maginot line of perspiration dots had popped out in single file on his forehead. Still, he wanted to carry on, because we had yet to arrive at his favourite clam house, J.T. Farnham''s, a brief four minutes down the road, but nevertheless around several quite sickening corners.<p>

But as with any strenuous endeavour, so it is with clams: One must eat through the low points to attain the golden plain of digestion. In addition to a box of Farnham''s finest -- small, sweet, light and fresh, in clean oil, a very close runner-up to the paragons of the Village Restaurant -- we also ordered a small beer. Beer -- oh happy discovery! -- turns out to be the liver-cleansing antidote to fried clam overdose. The eatery was crisp and clean, sharply framed in blond pine, and uncrowded. I found I could eat and even talk again.<p>

This left only one spot, Essex Seafood. The young girl serving the clams there was very pretty. Unfortunately, in addition to changing the oil, she might have changed her sweatshirt as well, given that it appeared to have soaked up a barrel or two of light crude.<p>

"What do you think of the atmosphere?" my brother said, chewing vigorously and compulsively tending to our rating boxes.<p>

"It''s sort of classy," I said. <p>

"The knotty pine panelling with Arborite thing, you mean?"<p>

The ceiling was very low: An extremely tall young man in a rasta-style hat and an iridescent basketball costume was sweeping the floor, oblivious to the fact the he was repeatedly being nearly beheaded by a spinning ceiling fan.<p>

"What would you like to say about these?" I said. They were Ipswich clams, the real, pungent thing.<p>

"You cah deteck eh locah flavah," Tim said, his clamhole crammed with hot fricasseed mollusk. "Eh''s mah su''stance inna belly, unh uh creamiah tas." <p>

He finally swallowed. "But they''re much richer, and probably fattier."<p>

"That would be the Essex mud," I said.<p>

"It''s almost like eating foie gras."<p>

And, of course, he had it. This is what fried clams are: foie gras for everyman, the caviar of the yobs.<p>

By the time we got back to my brother''s home, half an hour later, we''d consumed 41 fried clams each, and there were 52 left for tomorrow. There wasn''t much we hadn''t talked about, so we poured two bowls of cereal, ate them and went to bed. Some day, I must tell you about the dreams we had.<p>

The expansion of the Federal Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act, SC 2000, c. 5 [&#8220;PIPEDA&#8221;] from matters of Federal jurisdiction into general application on 1 January 2004 now challenges municipalities to determine whether and when their activities may qualify as &#8220;commercial&#8221;. In addition, the Province&#8217;s Bill 31, the Health Information Protection Act, 2003, received second reading on 8 April 2004 and is proceeding to becoming law later this year.   Both these statutes will layer on top of Ontario&#8217;s Municipal Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act, R.S.O. 1990, c.M.56 [&#8220;MFIPPA&#8221;].     Municipalities, like other organizations, face difficulties in interpreting the obligations required of them under these laws, which are just part of the complex new personal information protection laws coming into force recently.<p>

1.	PIPEDA and municipalities<p>

Municipalities may find themselves subject to uncertainly as to the application of PIPEDA. Although some informal indication has been given by the Federal Privacy Commission that it may have little interest in pursuing complaints arising from violations of PIPEDA by municipalities, it does not appear that this position is expressly set out in law and, as a result, could pose a risk to municipalities placing confidence in its protection.    Municipalities, on a plain reading of PIPEDA, are indistinguishable from any other &#8220;organization&#8221; to which the Act applies.    Further, municipalities clearly collect, retain, use and disclose personal information as part of normal operations.  Personal information is defined under section 2(1) of PIPEDA as follows:<p>

"personal information" means information about an identifiable individual, but does not include the name, title or business address or telephone number of an employee of an organization.<p>

Through their supply of services to citizens, municipalities are significant handlers of this sort of data and have handled this information subject to MFIPPA for over a decade.     The key difference under PIPEDA, however, is that it only applies where the organization collects, uses or discloses this information in the course of &#8220;commercial activities&#8221; which is defined broadly to include &#8220;any particular transaction, act or conduct or any regular course of conduct that is of a commercial character...&#8221;    Where that is the case, PIPEDA may also apply.  <p>

A municipality participates in commercial activities when it competes in the marketplace providing or receiving goods or services which are also commercially available from the private sector.   Fees, fines and taxes would not apply as these are not marketplace activities but consider each of the following municipal commercial activities<ul><li>

Procurements</li><li>Operation of an airport
</li><li>Utility services
</li><li>Operates a parking lot
</li><li>Provides senior citizens housing 
</li><li>Manages social housing tenant lists for third party housing providers</li></ul>

In light of the obvious involvement above, the message that the Federal Privacy Commissioner will not act upon complaints brought against municipalities is confusing.    The Federal Privacy Commissioner has no statutory authority not to receive reasonable complaints relating to municipal breaches of PIPEDA and does not control the process by which an individual complainant, unsatisfied with the position of the Commissioner brings a case to the Federal Court under s. 14(1).<p>

Given that confusion, municipalities would do well to consider the requirements of PIPEDA, including the detailed restrictions on collecting personal information as compared to the Municipal Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act where the collection occurs in a commercial context.     Collection can only occur under PIPEDA with the consent of the person, where the record falls into limited public categories or where: <p>

(a) the collection is clearly in the interests of the individual and consent cannot be obtained in a timely way;<p>

(b) it is reasonable to expect that the collection with the knowledge or consent of the individual would compromise the availability or the accuracy of the information and the collection is reasonable for purposes related to investigating a breach of an agreement or a contravention of the laws of Canada or a province; or<p>

(c) the collection is solely for journalistic, artistic or literary purposes.<p>

Similar - but different - restricted rules apply to the use and disclosure of personal information under PIPEDA.   The Act also has a set of ten general principles to be applied in the administration of personal information all of which have to be applied wherever a municipality handles information falling under the statute&#8217;s application.<p>


2.	Bill 31 &#8211; the Health Information Protection Act, 2003<p>

Like PIPEDA, Bill 31 will bring in a separate set of rules in relation to a distinct class of personal information.   This statute will apply to municipalities in Ontario which act as &#8220;health information custodians&#8221; whether in the operation of a long-term care facility or otherwise.      The purposes of Bill 31 include the establishment of rules for the collection, use and disclosure of personal health information about individuals that protect the confidentiality of that information and the privacy of individuals with respect to that information, while facilitating the effective provision of health care;<p>

Bill 31 does try to define its own scope of application.    Section 8(2) of Bill 31 states that, except in certain circumstances, the Municipal Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act does not apply to personal health information collected by a health information custodian or in the custody or under the control of a health information custodian.     Further, like PIPEDA, Bill 31 proposes a set of principles which apply wherever a municipality handles information falling under the statute&#8217;s application.    However, Bill 31 does not reference the Federal statute PIPEDA and provides for a set of rules for the handling of personal information which, though similar to those in PIPEDA, are not identical to those set out under Federal law.      For example, PIPEDA speaks of implied consent to a collection in certain circumstances where Bill 31 uses the alternate concept of approved indirect collection.<p>

One can see that where personal information is handled in a commercial health related context that there is an opportunity for overlap between Bill 31 and PIPEDA and &#8211; given the right circumstances - MFIPPA as well.   One such example might arise with a municipal long-term care facility where residents personally pay for the services they receive and where those residents could have also chosen a private facility for their care.      While the Federal Privacy Commission might state that they would not engage with a PIPEDA complaint, from the point of view of the municipality any complaint would have to be assessed and given response potentially under all three statutes.   <p>

3.	Conclusion<p>

The illustration above is indicative of how at the edges many of the personal information protections being legislated at this time are not well-dove tailed with each other.    Further, the unraveling of Federal and Provincial jurisdiction over privacy law is a matter which is presently before the Courts based on a case brought by the Province of Quebec against the Federal Government at the end of last year.   This case, however, will not likely be ruled upon before the passing of Bill 31 and will not be given in the context of the obligations of a municipality under these three statutes.    In the interim and likely beyond, municipalities will have to make practical determinations based on available resources, the goal of good client services as well as something approaching best intentions to comply with the multi-layered and unaligned nature of current personal information protection law.', '2004-08-09 20:08:07', '2008-06-12 14:46:57.799514', 0, true, true, true, 'pipedavsmfippa', true);

TIGNISH  &#8212;  The community council in Tignish wants the government to lift the provincial ban on canned pop. It hopes that will put end to cleaning up broken glass in public places.<p>

It''s against the law to sell carbonated beverages in cans in P.E.I. The government maintains it''s an environmental issue, and people are less likely to litter if the bottles are returnable.<p>

However, that''s not the case in the western P.E.I. community. People are smashing bottles all over the place.<p>

"We''ve been experiencing a number of situations where we have broken bottles, especially in our recreation parks where we have the beach volleyball court and we find a lot of broken glass in the sand," said community council chair Elmer Arsenault. "We have to clean that out before it hurts some of the kids that are playing there. Also the slides, and the gazebo that we have there ? in the washroom. We find broken bottles every so often on our roads, our streets, our sidewalks."<p>

The council reasons cans are much easier to clean up. Arsenault said a letter has been sent to Environment Minister Jamie Ballem making the case for canned pop.', '2004-08-20 17:10:18', '2008-06-12 14:46:57.813421', 0, true, true, true, 'cbcpei20august', true);

Bloomberg News<br>
Thursday, October 14, 2004 - Page R9<p>
MELBOURNE -- Keith Miller, Australia''s most prolific all-rounder in international test cricket, has died at a nursing home near here.<p>

Mr. Miller, who played 55 tests for Australia between 1946 and 1956, was an aggressive middle-order batsman and strike bowler. In test play, he scored 2,958 runs at an average of 36.97 and took 170 wickets at 22.97. He also played 50 matches for Australian rules football team St. Kilda and was a bomber pilot in the Second World War.<p>

"Keith Miller was a genuine legend, a man whose dashing approach helped cricket regain its place in the public affection after the dark years of World War Two," said Bob Merriman, chairman of Cricket Australia.<p>

"He was one of those rare athletes who could turn a game with bat, ball or with an impossible catch."<p>

His best performance with the ball was 7-60 against England at Brisbane in 1946, although Mr. Miller would often say he hated bowling. With the bat, he got seven Test hundreds with a highest score of 147 against West Indies in Kingston in 1955. He also scored 181 in his first-class debut for Victoria. He later moved to Sydney and represented New South Wales.<p>

Statistics meant little to Mr. Miller. He gave up his wicket playing against English county Essex on Australia''s 1948 tour of England, when Sir Donald Bradman led the so-called unbeaten "Invincibles."<p>

"He was a man who understood that the game, great as it is, is just a game, and he played it that way," Mr. Merriman said.<p>

On his final tour in 1956, Mr. Miller recorded his highest first-class score of 281 against Leicestershire. He came out of retirement in 1959 to play one match for Nottinghamshire against Cambridge University, scoring an unbeaten 102. He continued to visit England every year, staying with his cricketing-fanatic friend, the late billionaire John Paul Getty II.<p>

Mr. Miller became a journalist after his sport career, wrote six books and was awarded the title of Member of the Order of the British Empire for his services to cricket. He died Oct. 10 at age 84.', '2004-10-15 16:53:24', '2008-06-12 14:46:57.841148', 0, true, true, true, 'globeandmail14', true);

I took a bit of time this weekend to try to draw up something that looked like a ye-olde beer-label. I didn''t quite succeed, but what I came up with might still be good enough to use (don''t feel obligated 
though).   Let me know what you think of this: 
http://actsofvolition.com/images/beerblog-test.png  (also attached to this email).

If you like it, rather than just sticking it on the top of the site, I''d like to change the design of the site a bit so that it fits in nicely.

Let me know,

</blockquote>2.  Monday 25 October 2004, me to Steve:<blockquote class="smalltext">That is very good.  The colours are spot on and it looks right...but the imagery is German and lager and a little bit Coors.   You have to be something of a beer nerd to get that and I am quite mortified even to be writing this, you having done this as a gift, but I think you would want to know why.<p>I would think the best theme would be more English village or even early industrial England.   The days of canals - yes.    Most of what I write about are big ales.   Lagers arose in the German Alps when brewers around 1500 realized they could store (German for &#8220;to store&#8221; is &#8220;lager&#8221;) in mountain caves.  It became known as &#8220;marzen&#8221; (German for &#8220;March&#8221;) and would be sold in October.   Lagers were only popular after 1840 when Carlsberg cloned a yeast that could ferment at 5 degrees Celsuis.   From that came refrigeration of beer and from that "Bud Draft Dry Ice Lite" or "the death of flavour".  Hence the Busch ads &#8220;head for the mountains&#8221; bragging that the beer tastes like mountain springs &#8211; like water. <p>Consider these images:<ul><li>Here is a search on Google images for Thomas Hardy Ale: <a href="http://images.google.ca/images?q=hardy%20ale&hl=en&lr=&sa=N&tab=wi">site</a>
</li><p><li>Here is a small photo of an actual tavern by a canal probably one hundred years ago: <a href="http://www.genx40.com/images/2004c/Brimington - Canal Tavern.jpg">site</a></li><p><li>Here is a search on Google images for "railway ale": <a href="http://images.google.ca/images?hl=en&lr=&q=railway+ale&btnG=Search">site</a>.
The children&#8217;s characters on Thomas the Tank Engine are not unrelated to the life of tavern and ale.</li><p><li>One of the more interesting images associated with traditional ale is the medieval figure of the Green Man, which is carved into churches and represents the vegetative world and a northern European Dionysian outlook, something ale which would have &#8211; as it is made of grain, hop (a bitter weed of hedgerows) and wild yeast from the woods and orchards: <a href="http://images.google.ca/images?hl=en&lr=&q=green+man&btnG=Search">site</a>
In terms of brewing, the Green Man manifests in the hops. </li></ul>Again, your idea to redesign and reconfigure is most welcome and if there were time and money it would be best to walk you though great taverns, get you awash with bitters and stouts, essentially ruin you to make you whole.   Consider these five historic pubs on London as recorded in the CAMRA website: <a href="http://www.camra.org.uk/SHWebClass.ASP?WCI=ShowCat&CatID=110">site</a>
<p>As you know, I have all the time in the world to share about ale so do not let me take up too much of your time.<p>A filigree of hopvine perchance?<p>Alan</blockquote><p>3.  Later Monday SG to me:<blockquote class="smalltext">I was sure when designing to make sure I could swap out the mountain photo easily for something else.  Although, for the record, those mountains are Austrian - hardly Coors ;-).    
<a href="http://www.genx40.com/images/2004c/Brimington%20-%20Canal%20Tavern.jpg">This photo of the tavern might work well</a>.<p>I''ll try it and let you know,<p>Steven Garrity</blockquote><p><p>4. Later again to SG from me:<blockquote class="smalltext">Would that be Adolph Coors?   They have been stuck with an unfortunate ... shall we say ... <a href="http://www.faqs.org/faqs/beer-faq/part2/section-23.html">mid-20th century, central European thing</a>. <p>
If you do that swap and make the font more <a href="http://www.burrows.com/morris/gossip.html">William Morris</a> than Kaiser Wilhelm, Arts and Crafts like the <a href="http://www.horton-brasses.com/products/drawerpulls/mackintosh
">Mackintosh style at Horton Brasses</a> that would be very cool, very on point.<p>Alan</blockquote>5. SG to me:<blockquote class="smalltext">Touche!<p>I''m down to these two attached images as label/logo candidates. You
don''t have a higher quality version of that Brimington Canal Tavern photo, do you?<p>Steven</blockquote>6. Me to SG:<blockquote class="smalltext">No - that was just ripped from the web.   If you go sepia with it in your mountain oval I would think that would be fine.<p>Alan</blockquote>7. SG to me later in the evening:<blockquote class="smalltext">New design is up - still has be Coors mountains - couldn''t do better yet
- hopefully it won''t humiliate you in the world of beer connoisseurs.<p>Steven</blockquote>8. Me the next morning to SG:<blockquote class="smalltext">It is fabulous.   And it reminds me of marsen, hefe-weizen and pilsner urquel - wonderful Alpen-ish brews all.  I have been un-mountainly and you have made me better.   It is quite lovely.  Thanks.

By DAVID CRARY / Associated Press Writer - Monday, November 1, 2004 at 9:28 AM<p>

MONTREAL (AP) &#8212; Measured by shared boundaries and trade, no foreign country has a larger stake in the U.S. presidential election than Canada. Its citizens, by an overwhelming margin, hope for President Bush&#8217;s defeat, but its government &#8212; unsure of the Nov. 2 outcome &#8212; is trying to keep bilateral tensions from escalating.<p>

Many Canadians have intently followed the campaign, watching the TV debates and writing impassioned letters to newspapers. Two recent polls showed Democrat John Kerry favored by more than 2-to-1 across Canada; in French-speaking Quebec, Bush&#8217;s support was only 11 percent.<p>

Bush&#8217;s decision to invade Iraq has been a major factor. After the invasion last year, Montreal Canadiens fans began booing during the U.S. national anthem, and anti-war protesters even jeered a Massachusetts youth hockey team at a tournament.<p>

&#8220;Canadians have become leading Bushophobes,&#8221; said Gil Troy, a New York City native who teaches history at Montreal&#8217;s McGill University. &#8220;The fundamental U.S.-Canada relationship remains incredibly strong. ... but there&#8217;s an extreme demonization of Bush, a notion of him as an uncultured cowboy.&#8221;<p>

The unpredictability of the election, and the pervasive anti-Bush sentiment, present the Canadian government with delicate challenges as it works to maintain constructive relations with its far more powerful neighbor.<p>

On one hand, the Liberal Party government disappointed the White House by refusing to send troops to Iraq. The world&#8217;s largest trading partners also are feuding over Canadian lumber exports and a U.S. ban on Canadian cattle imposed last year because of fears of mad cow disease.<p>

On the other hand, Prime Minister Paul Martin has pledged repeatedly to improve ties with the United States &#8212; which deteriorated under his predecessor, Jean Chretien. Martin&#8217;s government has worked closely with U.S. officials on border security and has irked left-wing opposition parties by negotiating on a partnership in the United States&#8217; new continental missile defense program.<p>

Though a final decision on joining the missile program has not been made, Defense Minister Bill Graham clearly favors a Canadian role &#8212; regardless of whether Bush is re-elected.<p>

&#8220;It&#8217;s not about American domestic politics. It&#8217;s about North American security,&#8221; Graham told the Ottawa Citizen. &#8220;Whether it&#8217;s Republican or Democrat down there, we want them to look us in the eye and say, &#8217;We&#8217;re your partner&#8217;.&#8221;<p>

Both Kerry and Bush support the idea of a new missile defense system, but Kerry says he would proceed more slowly with its development.<p>

Martin and Graham have not set a timetable for their missile defense decision; they have promised to allow a nonbinding vote in the House of Commons, where the Liberals lack an outright majority.<p>

The left-of-center opposition parties &#8212; the New Democrats and separatist Bloc Quebecois &#8212; have denounced Martin for even considering a role in the program.<p>

&#8220;Canada shouldn&#8217;t reward George Bush&#8217;s choice to tear up an arms control treaty that prevented Star Wars development,&#8221; said New Democrat leader Jack Layton.<p>

Even some Liberals oppose Canadian engagement in the program. Toronto-area lawmaker Carolyn Parrish said at a protest rally in August: &#8220;We are not joining the coalition of the idiots. We should be joining the coalition of the wise.&#8221;<p>

The Conservatives, Parliament&#8217;s largest opposition group, tentatively favor Canadian participation in the missile program, believing that opting out would jeopardize NORAD &#8212; the U.S.-Canadian North American Air Defense command.<p>

&#8220;There&#8217;s an old strain of anti-Americanism thCanadianat runs through an element of the Canadian political culture,&#8221; said Jason Kenney, a Parliament member who is Conservative spokesman on U.S.-Canadian relations.<p>

&#8220;It&#8217;s always a bit of a dance,&#8221; he said. &#8220;But most sober-minded Canadians realize we have to work with whatever U.S. administration is in power.&#8221;<p>

Pierre Martin, a University of Montreal political science professor, said the Liberal government is taking a pragmatic approach, perhaps sensing that complications will persist &#8212; notably in trade disputes &#8212; even if Kerry is elected.<p>

Martin said many Canadians dislike Bush because of their perception that he is too beholden to conservative Christians and too willing to mix religion with politics. In Canada, religious groups have relatively little political influence, abortion is less controversial than in the United States, and gay marriage is on the way to becoming legal nationwide.<p>

The most recent Canadian poll about the U.S. election, published last week in Montreal&#8217;s La Presse, reflected deep unease over Bush&#8217;s foreign policies, but also highlighted the dilemma of America&#8217;s northern neighbor. A resounding 95 percent of the Canadians surveyed said it is important to maintain good relations with the United States.<p>

At the White House and State Department, questions about Bush&#8217;s low standing in Canadian polls were politely deflected. The administration&#8217;s official line is that bilateral relations are good, the trade disputes are difficult but solvable, and Canada must make its own decision regarding the missile defense program.<p>

&#8220;There are some issues where we have disagreed in the past, and some where we continue to disagree,&#8221; Assistant Secretary of State Roger Noriega said in a recent speech. &#8220;It isn&#8217;t always easy, but the relationship, I believe, remains strong.&#8221;', '2004-11-02 13:28:36', '2008-06-12 14:46:57.871605', 0, true, true, true, 'watertowndaily', true);

Without doubt he did more for the winemaking fraternity than anyone else.  In fact there probably would not have been the unison of so many winemakers in Great Britain and overseas had it not been for his energy and acumen.<p>After World War II, when sugar came off the ration, Cyril founded the Andover Circle, which still flourishes today and of which he was still a member.   Then Cheltenham, Bournemouth, Harrow and Hertford Circles sprang to life and gradually the bubbles of wine spread all over the country.  Clubs learnt about each others'' events through a little magazine which Cyril and his dear wife Peggy produced in the upstairs bedroom of their house in Andover.  This was for sale to Clubs at 6 pence a copy.<p>Cyril had an ebullient personality and energy which not only embraced his family and social life but also gave him the courage at a mature age to give up his safe, professional life as Editor of a local Andover paper in order to concentrate on producing the Amateur Winemaker magazine on a National scale.  He also wrote the best-ever selling winemaking book ''First Steps in Winemaking.''  Not only was the title very clever and appealing but it gave people the chance to make wines from fruits, flowers and vegetables in an easily explained manner.   Yes, the recipes were ''country''  style,  often using a lot of sugar, but they gave the encouragement necessary to try them out and, in those early days, it was THE book to own.  When a chicken was really a treat to be eaten just at Christmas and a bottle of wine had to be sought out and afforded only once in a while, the idea of making one''s own wine was very attractive.  No rows of wine in Supermarkets then.<p>The main names at that time which readily come to mind after Cyril were  Cyril Lucas of Bournemouth, Ben Turner of Harrow, ''Andy'' Andrews of Hertford; they and some others got together to form a nucleus to start the National Conferences.  A little later, after a Conference in Brighton, the Amateur Winemakers National Guild of Judges was formed (now N.G.W.B.J.)   In those very early days Cyril was asked to assess vast volumes of competition wine at one sitting, which he manfully attempted. No wonder the Judges Guild was formed!<p>Clubs proliferated and prospered, friendships all over the country were cemented, winemaking graduated from granny''s country brew to commercial quality counterparts, all in essence due to Cyril Berry''s original initiative and drive.  Winemaking queries were answered, informative articles published and Club News kept everyone informed.  Someone once sent in to the Winemaker a recipe for a Yorkshire Pudding wine as a joke (Jack Dixon I believe - now no longer with us) and to keep the joke going Cyril printed it.  He was taken aback some months later, however, when a member of the Andover Circle asked him to taste just such a ''wine''!    Many books associated with wine and beer making evolved from Cyril''s printing presses until he eventually retired and bought a holiday flat in Nerja, Spain, so as to enjoy the winter sunshine.<p>Although Peggy, Gay and Natalie, their daughters, and the grandchildren, were the heart of Cyril''s life, he found time for other interests such as gardening, viticulture, music and painting.  He even had time to be on the local Council and received the honour of being Mayor of Andover at one time.<p>He was a warm, friendly, very special person, who will never be forgotten by those who loved and admired him - always with a smile and a joke on his lips - truly the Father of the winemaking movement.  Blessed he was to leave us, sitting having a pre-prandial drink in the Spanish sunshine, but our heartfelt sympathies must go to Peggy and his family for his passing and the abruptness of this sad farewell.

By COLIN FREEZE<p>
Saturday, November 13, 2004 - Page A6<p>
An Ontario judge has awarded an archeologist $125,000 in damages after a native man used e-mails to smear her as a "grave robber." The archeologist''s lawyer is calling the ruling a precedent-setting one in the emerging field of Internet libel, a notion that may eventually have a chilling effect on the freewheeling ways computer users send messages.   "People seem to think there is a level of anonymity to e-mail and the Internet. And that it''s a lawless area," said winning lawyer Berkley Sells. "And clearly it is not, nor should it be."<p>

In a decision released this week, Madam Justice Wailan Low of the Ontario Superior Court sketched out a rough hierarchy of what she called "cyberlibel."  Posting slanderous remarks on a popular website, where millions of users might pick them up and circulate them, might be one the more egregious uses of technology, she said. But close behind that is e-mailing libellous remarks in an attempt to smear someone''s reputation.  Clearly, the use of e-mail is far more powerful than the sending out of a multiple of hard-copy letters defaming the plaintiff," Judge Low ruled.<p>The Internet is rife with people insulting one another, but what made this case defamatory was that the medium was used in a calculated attempt to defame someone''s professional reputation. The native man circulated his e-mail widely and asked it to be passed along to as many people as possible.  And eventually, the message made it onto the computer monitors of government regulators and the archeologist''s bosses. This meant it was "calculated to cause the plaintiff the maximum embarrassment and professional harm," according to Judge Low.<p>
The plaintiff is Cheryl Ross, a prehistoric archeologist affiliated with Wilfrid Laurier University, in Waterloo, Ont., who sued Pat Holley over his comments.  Dr. Ross had befriended Mr. Holley''s wife while working on the site of an Indian reserve that was once home to a 17th-century Huron village. Court documents indicate that Mr. Holley has long acted erratically, especially as he came to blame the archeologist for the breakdown of his marriage.<p>The lawsuit said that in October, 2003, Mr. Holley sent more than 30 people an e-mail titled "beware of . . . grave robber cheryl ross archeologist." It asserted that she "robbed" human remains from his driveway, in conjunction with one of her supervisors at the university.  "Please forword [sic] this to as many people and list as possible," the e-mail said. <p>That started a chain reaction, in which the false allegations -- buttressed with pictures of bone fragments that Mr. Holley said were human remains -- were passed along until they reached the registrar of Ontario''s cemeteries unit.   He contacted Wilfrid Laurier University about the e-mail, and court documents show that exchange led to another one in which Dr. Ross''s supervisor e-mailed her to ask: "Cheryl, what the hell is going on? . . . I know that none of this is true but I need to know why they would be accusing you of [this]," the supervisor said. "We need to jump on this soon as it could effect you professionally at least in Canada."<p>Mr. Holley did not appear in court to defend himself. Judge Low agreed that the e-mail was malicious, defamatory and untrue. General damages were pegged at $75,000 plus another $50,000 in aggravated damages.  The judge did this, knowing it amounted to hitting Mr. Holley for all he was worth, or very close to it. In her decision, she said the damages amounted to "equivalent to all or a significant portion of the defendant''s assets."<p>Before this, there has been very little case law in the field of cyberlibel, although a June Ontario Court of Appeal decision was instructive. In that case, a homeless Vancouver man was ordered to pay $125,000 for libelling Barrick Gold Corp. in Internet postings.', '2004-11-15 04:16:19', '2008-06-12 14:46:57.891125', 0, true, true, true, 'globeandmail13', true);

By Simon Doyle<p>
Local News - Wednesday, April 20, 2005 @ 07:00

Preserved, 140-year-old peas, uncovered by archeological investigators behind City Hall, may portend greater finds to come.  This week, excavators cracked open the asphalt of the Market Square lot, as part of an archeological investigation that prefaces reconstruction of the square.  Diggers unearthed ancient peas that survived a spectacular fire that razed the market wing of City Hall in 1865.  Although burned in the fire, they were neatly preserved through fossilization and once held in a stoneware crock, which lay around the the peas, shattered.  Ã¢??The butchers and everybody had stored their food in that building,Ã¢?Â said Nick Gromoff, the archeologist who found the peas Monday afternoon. Ã¢??And I thought of this as dried peas being stored for winter.Ã¢?Â<p>On Jan. 10, 1865, the market wing of City Hall burned in a dangerous blaze, with winds feeding the flames so powerfully that they nearly leaped to the main City Hall building on Ontario Street.  The town major had been prepared to explode a gunpowder mine to collapse the market building and extinguish the fire, according to a briefing report on the dig by the Cataraqui Archaeological Research Foundation.  The winds slowed, however, and the fire brigade was able to contain the damage to the market wing.  The fire left only a shell of limestone walls, which had become fragile from the heat of the flames and had to be pulled down.  <p>ItÃ¢??s over those burned remains that staff from the archeological foundation began exploring Market Square on Monday. They hope to piece together a better idea of how the market was set up and what goods were available, said Sue Bazely, head of the exploration.  <p>Ã¢??WeÃ¢??re getting evidence of the things that were being sold,Ã¢?Â Bazely said.  Gromoff found the peas just under the paved surface, which construction crews have been removing for about a week. He thinks there was a deep cellar under the market wing, and that after the fire, crews collapsed the wreckage, filling it up.  Ã¢??The building burns, the roof caves in and all thatÃ¢??s left is the shell,Ã¢?Â Gromoff said.  If this is the case, there will be more, still salvageable parts of the building under the ground. They would be of great importance, he said, because historians know little about the market or the buildingÃ¢??s architecture.  The crew may even find remains of the original clock tower that topped the wing. People of the time probably salvaged the bells, Gromoff said, Ã¢??but who knows?Ã¢?Â<p>Market Square has served as a market since 1801.  After buying the lot from the Crown in 1840, the Town of Kingston laid out ambitious plans to build a city hall on the property, the foundation says.  In its time, Kingston City Hall was such a large and grandiose structure, historians speculate that its architects hoped it would become the home for Parliament in the future capital of Canada.  In their planning for the building, local magistrates stressed that the town needed a shelter for market vendors. In 1834 it was to be called New Market House.  Ã¢??The building, which will be cut of stone, will contain 28 stalls and as many butcher shops,Ã¢?Â said one announcement from the district magistrates, according to the foundationÃ¢??s report. Ã¢??The upper floor is to be partly occupied as a commodious Town Hall.Ã¢?Â  City Hall was completed in 1844.<p>Old photos of the market wing show it stretching right up to King Street, where vendors now occupy a slot of pavement in front of the fenced-off archeological dig.  The building had several levels, Bazely said. Vendors selling meat and dairy likely would have occupied the cellar stalls where it was cooler.  Where thereÃ¢??s historical evidence to be found, the crew will continue to dig, she said, but she doesnÃ¢??t expect to go below two metres in the deepest areas.  There may be evidence of early settlements by the French or even Aboriginal Peoples, says the foundation.  In its test digs in 2002 and 2003, Bazely said, the crew found oyster shells and sheep feet that would have been sold at the market.  The crew hopes to finish its excavation by the end of May.<p>As part of the cityÃ¢??s $5.4-million plan to revitalize the the square, construction crews will then take over to build an outdoor skating rink and and expand the vendor area.  The rink is scheduled to be ready for next winter.  Before that, however, the archeological foundation may have a burned up piano or two to find from the marketÃ¢??s piano merchant.  Ã¢??Apparently,Ã¢?Â said Bazely, Ã¢??there was a grand piano in there.Ã¢?Â', '2005-04-20 17:43:06', '2008-06-12 14:46:57.946467', 0, true, true, true, 'kingstonwhig20', true);

Posted: 10:02 a.m. ET<br>
CNN''s Jim Spellman in New Orleans, Louisiana<p>

I don''t think I really have the vocabulary for this situation.<p>

We just heard a couple of gunshots go off. There''s a building smoldering a block away. People are picking through whatever is left in the stores right now. They are walking the streets because they have nowhere else to go.<p>

Right now, I''m a few blocks away from the New Orleans Convention Center area. We drove through there earlier, and it was unbelievable. Thousands and thousands and thousands of people spent the night sleeping on the street, on the sidewalk, on the median.<p>

The convention center is a place that people were told to go to because it would be safe. In fact, it is a scene of anarchy.<p>

There is absolutely nobody in control. There is no National Guard, no police, no information to be had.<p>

The convention center is next to the Mississippi River. Many people who are sleeping there feel that a boat is going to come and get them. Or they think a bus is going to come. But no buses have come. No boats have come. They think water is going come. No water has come. And they have no food.<p>

As we drove by, people screamed out to us -- "Do you have water? Do you have food? Do you have any information for us?"<p>

We had none of those.<p>

Probably the most disturbing thing is that people at the convention center are starting to pass away and there is simply nothing to do with their bodies. There is nowhere to put them. There is no one who can do anything with them. This is making everybody very, very upset.<p>', '2005-09-01 21:38:06', '2008-06-12 14:46:57.985882', 0, true, true, true, 'cnn1september', true);

Local News - Thursday, November 03, 2005 @ 07:00<p>They pump their water from wells and boil it before they drink. Meanwhile, they face the prospect of an expanded dump upstream from their homes.  The Mohawks of the Bay of Quinte know a thing or two about bad water.  Chief R. Donald Maracle, who has been fighting to ensure the garbage dump won&#8217;t poison his people&#8217;s water supply, says it&#8217;s no wonder the water crisis in the northern Ontario community of Kashechewan occurred. He says it&#8217;s because the collective Canadian attitude toward First Nations has been so cold.<p>&#8220;Canada is a very rich country. Ontario is a very rich province. There is no reason why these Third World conditions for First Nation people should prevail,&#8221; Maracle said in a telephone interview yesterday.  &#8220;We can certainly understand the plight of the Kashechewan people. It&#8217;s a widespread problem.&#8221;  Located about 50 kilometres west of Kingston, the Mohawk territory of Tyendinaga on the Bay of Quinte is home to about 3,000 natives who rely on groundwater for drinking, bathing and washing.   In 2003, a consultant&#8217;s report showed 57 per cent of the reserve&#8217;s 620 wells were contaminated. One-third of the wells were too shallow to continuously yield water and 113 were deemed to be under the influence of upstream pollutants.<p>Now, the reserve also finds itself battling to keep Waste Management Canada from expanding the landfill sits on, increasing it&#8217;s intake to 750,000 tonnes of garbage a year from 125,000.  The consultant&#8217;s report also indicated that the Richmond site is founded on fractured bedrock, which allows leachate to seep into a stream that runs through the dump right into the Tyendinaga territory.<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s just another battle. We don&#8217;t need a project to come in and make worse what is already a bad situation,&#8221; Maracle said. Maracle claims that among the pollutants seeping into the reserve&#8217;s surface water are E. coli bacteria, the same bacteria that forced the massive Kashechewan evacuation after residents became very ill. #8220;There&#8217;s nothing stopping another Kashechewan from happening anywhere that water is still being boiled,&#8221; said Bryan Hendry, a spokesman for the Assembly of First Nations.  &#8220;It could happen at the Bay of Quinte. It could happen anywhere.&#8221;  Hendry said that of the 37 Ontario native reserves under a boil-water advisory, the Bay of Quinte/Tyendinaga territory actually has some of the cleanest water supplies.  He cites Moose Deer Point, a tiny reserve of 132 people just south of Parry Sound, where residents have been boiling their water for six years.  &#8220;I find it just incredible that a place could be like that for so long,&#8221; Hendry said. <p>Some reserves may only have to boil drinking water for a couple of minutes, while others have to wait an hour. It&#8217;s so bad, he says, some places have to boil their water just to bathe because the concentration of bacteria is so high.  At Tyendinaga, the water is at least safe enough for bathing, but Maracle still doesn&#8217;t endorse any use of unboiled water &#8211; for drinking or otherwise.  &#8220;If you get into the water with a break in the skin, who knows?&#8221; he said. &#8220;I tell people here if they can get their water by any other means to do so.&#8221;  Maracle says he&#8217;s been told by the Ontario government that $10 million is earmarked for a new water-treatment facility for his people, but he hasn&#8217;t yet seen any steps taken to build it.  The continued population growth of southern and eastern Ontario worries Maracle, who says his water supply will keep deteriorating with greater agricultural and industrial development.  He hopes Kashechewan will generate the necessary political pressure to fix contaminated water on First Nation&#8217;s Reserves.  &#8220;Nothing less than a parliamentary approach will work,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We&#8217;re relying on the public purse. We need help.&#8221;<p>Meanwhile, natives of Kashechewan continue to be flown out of the northern community for temporary refuge in other Ontario towns and cities. Yesterday, Peterborough said it could take 125 people.  About 815 people have been relocated to lodgings across the province, with the majority taking refuge in Ottawa, Sudbury and Cochrane. Kashechewan community leaders have identified another 87 people still in need of evacuation, while others will be airlifted to Sudbury on day trips for medical evaluation.<p>Kingston Mayor Harvey Rosen has already offered temporary shelter to some people here, but said yesterday &#8220;we haven&#8217;t heard anything yet.&#8221;  He also said he&#8217;d received a few negative reactions to his offer to accept native evacuees.  &#8220;They were reprehensible. So bad I can&#8217;t repeat them,&#8221; Rosen said. &#8220;I was actually quite shocked by them.&#8221;  But he said negative remarks would not deter him from offering refuge to displaced people.  &#8220;I think think it&#8217;s the right thing to do.&#8221;<p>&#8211; With files from Canadian Press <p>

If I can take credit for being around at <a href="http://www.ghostofaflea.com/archives/002405.html">the start of this project called the Red Ensign bloggers</a>, I would note that my first post in response to that first post of Packwood''s was on all <a href="http://www.genx40.com/archives/2004/june/redensigns">the variety of Red Ensigns there were in the world</a> and how they trace a common thread among many peoples wherever the British had been.  While I started simply as a flag lover, I did begin to notice a pattern - that the Red Ensign has often been present wherever the goals of freedom and liberty have been advanced...even if at certain times it was not raised on the side of that progress.    The Stars and Stripes is even a Red Ensign if you think of the white stripes as an overlay on a red ensign - which is actually how the design developed.<p><a href="images/2005g/memhall1.JPG"><img src="images/2005g/memhall1a.JPG" vspace="5" hspace="20" align="right"></a>

And that made me think about the fact that I am a lucky man.  I live in Canada and I am proud of by far the greatest part of what makes our nation what it is today.  It is neither perfect nor arose from any revolution - for much of the good I have a great debt to the continuing past.   I am a kid of the British Empire as I am a kid of Scots immigrants and the tail end of the Empire got us to Canada this time.  It was the first plane trip of emigration after years of sailing here...and back.   Many had been back and forth to Canada as far back as some relatives called McGill were in Quebec in the 1700s.   Apparently one great-grandfather of mine was even born in the US - imagine that.   None of these trips were anywhere near the most dangerous trip taken under the flag of the Empire either - those who went before were in India and the Sudan with the British redcoats - and to mention WWI and WWII in the next two generations.<p>   

Those generations forged peace.  I got to grow up here and enjoy that peace after a wave of mid-50s immigration only because I, like so many others, were born of parent who got to move here from so many lands.  I think of Canada as an expression of the success of the Empire in its tolerance and diversity of people who came to be Canadian five decades ago.   Inclusion of a sort has been part of the nature of Canada even back to the first British Empire and the centuries of success of the Quebec Act and protection for that part of the culture; similarly, the First Nations were protected by the Empire''s Royal Proclamation of 1761 but though with less success and respect.    We have our lost gratitude for people like those who fought at <a href="http://www.britishbattles.com/battle-of-quebec-1775.htm">Quebec in 1755</a> against the American invasion, and like <a href="http://www.genx40.com/archives/2004/april/stpaulsanglican">Molly Brant</a> whose force of thousands of Loyalist Mohawks basically kept Upper Canada from the British from the 1780s right through to the Rebellions of 1837 when Tyendenaga joined in the militia at Kingston.   If it were not for the choice and the bravery of the Brants and those that followed them north after the American Revolution, it is likely Canada would not go past Montreal these days.  We owe both recognition and debt to all these parts of our community.  We repay that through continuing acceptance and justice...or at least we should.   But  we fail and we get sidetracked, too.   Some even disparage our multicultural society but then compare Canada with<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2005/11/09/international/europe/09projects.html?th&emc=th">the recent experience in France</a>:<blockquote class="smalltext">

Amin Kouidri, 20, has been hunting for a job for more than two years now and spends his days drifting around a government housing project here under the watchful gaze of France''s national police.  He and his neighbors in one of France''s now-notorious housing projects say that they feel cut off from French society, a result of a process of segregation lasting for decades, and that alienation and pressure from the police have now exploded in rage across the country.</blockquote>
   
I don''t recognize this - even though my children go to school with kids unlike them in language, holidays, habits.  I don''t recognize it because it does not exist here.  In the school near here everyone''s experience is celebrated - even those of our vets.  This year the Remembrance Day events in that small elementary school were far more elaborate than anything I recall.  Maybe we have learned something from the Dutch who came here in such numbers in the 50s, something about remembering and respecting.  Maybe we lose that when we become adult and maybe we have problems needing resolution but I know I don''t recognize that rage in another country.  I can tell the difference.<p><a href="images/2005g/memhall.JPG"><img src="images/2005g/memhalla.JPG" vspace="5" hspace="20" align="left"></a>I am also lucky that I live in Kingston with its legacy of confederation world all around us as well as our memorials the those who sacrificed to give us the world we have today.  Throughout this post I have placed photos of the stained glass that was dedicated to remebrance of all who worked and fought for the Country in WWI.   It is hard to place ourselves in the minds of those who fought fascism in WWII and harder to conceive of the thoughts in the trenches in WWI.   They didn''t fight for may of the things any of the things we argue over now.  They did not fight for the libertarianism of I, me, mine.   Likewise there is likely not much Trudeaumania and what followed on their minds: large deficits rung up by gutless Grits and Tories from the 60s to the 90s.  They fought for their community, their friends, their home - a common belief in something right - and their efforts, despite <a href="http://www.dnd.ca/somalia/somaliae.htm">Somilia</a>, for that "something right" have continued in Korea, in the first Gulf War, in <a href="http://www.cda-cdai.ca/library/medakpocket.htm">the Medak Pocket</a>, with <a href="http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/index.cfm?PgNm=TCE&Params=M1ARTM0011934">our jets over Belgrade</a> and now with <a href="http://www.cbc.ca/news/background/cdnmilitary/jtf2.html">JTF2 in Afganistan</a>.  Don''t get me wrong - Canada is still really stunned sometimes <a href="http://www.cbc.ca/story/canada/national/2005/11/08/wenzel051108.html">like this</a>, too:<blockquote class="smalltext">Clifton Wenzel flew almost 50 combat missions during the Second World War and was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross and the Air Force Cross. But, in spite of his record, he was told when he left the service he didn''t qualify for a pension. </blockquote>But it has always been so.  There is a lot not to look back on with respect.   The past was when women had no vote, segregation in Canada was normal and the state insensibly intervened with prohibition and censorship.   Kids like one of the great Canadian Gordon Sinclair died unable to afford the doctor.  After the First World War, many of those that fought came home to fight in social equity and social programs for health care and other forms of relief expanded.  After the WWII, the common practice of excluding people from services and accomodation based on religion or race was no longer accepted and the first human rights codes came into law.   Conservative Prime Minister Diefenbacker reacted to the 1960s civil rights movement with the Bill of Rights.  The bar was raised further in the early 80s when all provincial governments but for the then separatist leaders of Quebec came from across the spectrum and signed on to entrenchment of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms in our constitution.   The economic miracle of the 20th century coincided with the movement from protection of the interests of the strong to rights for all under the hybrid of social democracy and free market capitalism we enjoy today. <p>Those are the things we can claim as the legacy of the past, too, and the Red Ensign is a great expression of that diversity, that progress, that fight.   That is why I like it so much.   That <a href="http://www.genx40.com/archives/2004/may/novascotianfish">old flag with a fish</a> on it...or <a href="http://www.genx40.com/archives/2003/may/flags">Jerome the giraffe.</a><p>

Rightjab has come back from the Arctic Island where he was stranded since June to write one triff post <a href="http://rightjab.blogspot.com/2005/11/election-2005.html">on the Federal election</a> (which surely must be coming if all the bloggers are talking about it) on the point that polls must be wrong as he has never been polled.

<a href="http://robot_guy.blogspot.com/">Robot Guy</a> has a 1970s-esque web site design going for him which is weird as the web only came into being about 15 years ago.

His coverage of the <a href="http://robot_guy.blogspot.com/2005/11/good-news-bad-news-for-npoess.html">National Polar-orbiting Operational Environmental Satellite System</a>  makes up for it.

Stephen Taylor is simply...the man.  I can say this because I have met him but unlike every other Red Ensign blogger I have met, I did not have beer with him.  He rightly honoured Remembrance Day with <a href="http://www.stephentaylor.ca/archives/000451.html">a field of poppies</a>.  He does most things rightly, come to think of it.  He announced the sad - nay, tragic - news that <a href="http://www.stephentaylor.ca/archives/000457.html">Paddy Binns</a>, the premier of PEI, might run for his old Federal seat currently held by a stick painted red or some other stalwart of the Big Red Machine.  He questions <a href="http://www.stephentaylor.ca/archives/000453.html">the polling methodology</a> of the Liberals...yet stays quiet on the whole issue of why Rightjabman has never been polled.  I know Monty knows, Steve knows Monty and now I want to know, too.<p>

His <a href="http://taylor.textamerica.com/details/?r=3652120">Remembrance Day post</a> (like mine...and damn few like us, I say) was an actual bit of citizen journalism with photos of many units present at the cenotaph at, I think, Old City Hall in Toronto.

The Freeway To Serfdom missed honouring Remembrance Day but contemplates the coming winter  in Canada <a href="http://jayjardine.blogspot.com/2005/11/winter-is-there.html">rather nicely</a>.  He speaks of being a <a href="http://jayjardine.blogspot.com/2005/11/introverts-are-people-who-find-other.html">bookish introvert</a>.

The Green Baron <a href="http://greenbaron.blogspot.com/2005_11_01_greenbaron_archive.html#113175520586540233">was displaced by Hurricane Katrina, suffered an engagement break-up and reinlisted in the US Army</a> and as a result did not post from the end of August until Remembrance Day.  Wow.  No disrespect but all I did in that time was put on some weight and blow at my hockey pool picks.  He is also quite, and quite uniquely, <a href="http://greenbaron.blogspot.com/2005_11_01_greenbaron_archive.html#113184031738678561">unkind to France</a>.<p>


The High Places did a great round up of Remembrance Day posts from <a href="http://mrcheevus.net/blog/2005/11/11/bt-remembrance-day-roundup/">the blogging Tories</a>, that other more successful blogroll that we secretly envy and despise...unless we are on it.  He ponders <a href="http://mrcheevus.net/blog/2005/11/18/the-gospel-according-to-lego/">an interpretation in Lego brick</a> of the greatest story ever told. He also takes a bash at the <a href="http://mrcheevus.net/blog/2005/11/16/vancouver-civic-election-cope-values-community/">Vancouver civic election</a> as well as <a href=" http://mrcheevus.net/blog/2005/11/16/surrey-civic-election/">the Surrey Civic Election</a>.  I like municipal politics and blogging except I can''t do it.  And he discusses <a href="http://mrcheevus.net/blog/2005/11/08/chock-and-awe-blogging-tories-jumping-to-conclusions">some</a> panicking Tories in light of the...impending Federal election.<p>

The London Fog is mostly about blogging municipal politics...but as it is 10:10 pm Saturday I will leave it to that for now and seek out a small jug of modestly priced but reasonably made medium oloroso to drive out the thoughts of the impending Federal election...<p>

OK - let''s try that again.  The London Fog is mostly about blogging municipal politics but takes a moment to recall Remembrance Day in the oddest way of all the Red Ensigns with a story relating how he can sympathize with <a href="http://thelondonfog.blogspot.com/2005/11/daddys-drunk-mommys-on-prozac-billys.html">vets providing recreational drugs for their pets</a>.  Other than that there are stories on or about issues surrounding what I am now referring to as the "IFE" including <a href="http://thelondonfog.blogspot.com/2005/11/purging-party.html">the cat who came back</a> and <a href="http://thelondonfog.blogspot.com/2005/11/stalin-favoured-five-year-plans-too.html">the economic plan</a> of the Grits all with a decidedly anti-Uncle-Joe slant.  On the municipal scene, <a href="http://thelondonfog.blogspot.com/2005/11/theres-truck-stuck-in-sewer.html">it''s all</a> about <a href="http://thelondonfog.blogspot.com/2005/11/sewers-were-neglected-in-favour-of-jlc.html">the sewers</a>.<p>

The Meatriarchy shares my Atlantic Canadian shock at <a href="http://www.meatriarchy.com/?p=327">the failure</a> to make Remembrance Day a public day of respect.<p>  He is also deeply involved with the <a href="http://www.meatriarchy.com/?p=338">War in Iraq</a> and <a href="http://www.meatriarchy.com/?p=336">the War on Terror</a>.  <a href="http://www.meatriarchy.com/?p=332">Open Source Media</a> makes him wonder about his own irrelevance.  I need no such catalyst to consider mine.

There you are.  Another 26<sup><small>th</small></sup> of a year encapsulated.  The job of preparing the Standard was both much longer and more interesting than I thought it would be.  These have been interesting times with the group to the point that even calling it a group and acting like a group is a challenge.  It is my hope that members will reassert themselves a club of people who are interested in good web writing, regular web writing and the analysis of events from a Canadian perspective or awareness that includes respect for and understanding of the traditions which have and continue to make this a great country.<p>Below is a list of previous issues of the Red Ensign Standard. Some of the links may be dead as some members have signed off over the year and a half since this project began.  Others have left the group through the sorts of finger-pointing schisms that only traditionalists can pull off.  In each Standard you will, however, find that particular member''s take on the group and its meaning.<blockquote><br /><ol><li><a href="http://www.thedonovan.com/archives/002390.html" target="_blank">Castle Argghhh</a></li><br /><li><a href="http://www.ragingkraut.com/index.php/weblog/red_ensign_standard_xxv/" target="_blank">Raging Kraut</a></li><br /><li><a href="http://thelastamazon.blogspot.com/2004/08/raising-red-ensign.html" target="_blank">The Last Amazon</a></li><br /><li><a href="http://bumfonline.blogspot.com/2004/09/red-ensign-standard.html" target="_blank">Bumfonline</a></li><br /><li><a href="http://halifax.blogspot.com/2004/09/red-ensign-standard_23.html" target="_blank">Tiger in Winter</a> (now blogging at <a href="http://moscowmetro.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">Tiger in Exile</a>)</li><br /><li><a href="http://taylor.textamerica.com/?r=1481714" target="_blank">Taylor and Company</a></li><br /><li><a href="http://myrick.blogspot.com/2004/10/red-ensign-standard_20.html" target="_blank">Myrick</a></li><br /><li><a href="http://www.boundbygravity.com/2004_11_01_bbgarchive.aspx#109988805579300952" target="_blank">Bound By Gravity</a></li><br /><li><a href="http://dustmybroom.com/2004/11/red-ensign-standard_20.html" target="_blank">Dust My Broom</a></li><br /><li><a href="http://ravishinglight.blogspot.com/2004/12/and-he-waved-scarlet-banner-to-and-fro.html" target="_blank">Ravishing Light</a></li><br /><li><a href="http://babblingbrooks.blogspot.com/2004/12/be-yours-to-hold-it-high.html" target="_blank">Babbling Brooks</a></li><br /><li><a href="http://www.hayz.ws/blog/index.php?p=1241" target="_blank">Musing</a></li><br /><li><a href="http://jayjardine.blogspot.com/2005/01/canada-last-great-nation-of-rugged.html" target="_blank">Freeway to Serfdom</a></li><br /><li><a href="http://hifromseoul.blogspot.com/2005/01/red-ensign-standard-14.html" target="_blank">Nathan''s Updates From Seoul</a></li><br /><li><a href="http://nitorinadversum.blogspot.com/2005/02/red-ensign-standard-15.html" target="_blank">Striving Against Opposition</a></li><br /><li><a href="http://phantomobserver.blogspot.com/2005/02/16th-edition-of-red-ensign-standard.html" target="_blank">The Phantom Observer</a></li><br /><li><a href="http://www.rueskitchen.com/index.php/weblog2/Standard17/" target="_blank">Abraca-Pocus!</a></li><br /><li><a href="http://tipperography.typepad.com/tipperography/2005/03/making_a_decisi.html" target="_blank">Tipperography</a></li><br /><li><a href="http://cdnsue.blogspot.com/2005/04/red-ensign-brigade-19.html" target="_blank">Turning 30 and a half</a></li><br /><li><a href="http://canadiancomment.blogspot.com/2005/04/red-ensign-brigade-20_25.html" target="_blank">Canadian Comment</a></li><br /><li><a href="http://thelondonfog.blogspot.com/2005/05/red-ensign-standard-no-xxi.html" target="_blank">London Fog</a></li><br /><li><a href="http://themonarchist.blogspot.com/2005/05/red-ensign-standard-no-xxii.html" target="_blank">The Monarchist</a></li><br /><li><a href="http://drizwald.blogspot.com/2005/06/be-it-yours-to-hold-high_06.html" target="_blank">West Coast Chaos</a></li><br /><li><a href="http://www.achicknamedmarzi.com/2005/06/welcome-to-red-ensign-standard.html" target="_blank">A Chick Named Marzi</a></li><br /><li><a href="http://www.ragingkraut.com/index.php/weblog/red_ensign_standard_xxv/" target="_blank">Raging Kraut</a></li><br /><li><a href="http://robot_guy.blogspot.com/2005/07/red-ensign-standard-xxvi.html" target="_blank">Robot Guy</a></li><br /><li><a href="http://mrcheevus.net/blog/2005/07/30/red-ensign-standard-issue-xxvii/" target="_blank">The High Places</a></li><br /><li><a href="http://thelastamazon.blogspot.com/2005/09/red-ensign-standard-volume-xxvlll.html" target="_blank">The Last Amazon</a></li><br /><li><a href="http://robot_guy.blogspot.com/2005/10/red-ensign-standard-xxix.html" target="_blank">Robot Guy</a></li><br /><li><a href="http://www.bolditalic.com/quotulatiousness_archive/002005.html">Quotulatiousness</a></li><br /><li><a href="http://rootleweb.blogspot.com/2005/11/red-ensign-standard-xxxi.html">RootleWeb</a>

<p><h2 id="shchallenge">Senior High Summer Challenge - North Conway, New Hampshire</h2></p>  
<p>This is a long-standing tradition in the Solid Rock Youth.   Slated as 7-day co-ed event and centered in the Mt. Washington region of New Hampshire, this trip offers a bit of everything: camping, hiking, shopping, swimming and white-water rafting.  Two days of backpacking in the mountains include a climb to the 6288 ft. Mt. Washington summit.  The following day of relaxation and shopping the quaint downtown shops and outlet malls in picturesque North Conway, comes as a welcome relief for aching muscles. On the return trip, you&#8217;ll enjoy the thrill and excitement of a half-day white-water rafting expedition.  In the end, perhaps the most memorable moments will be those spent with close friends around the evening campfires.</p>-->

<p><h2 id="wcamp">Senior High Group Workcamp Mission Trip - Bridgeton, New Jersey</h2></p>
<p>A Solid Rock First!!  This mission trip is for youth who want to be challenged in their faith but make an impact in the lives of those not as fortunate as they are and in the community.  This trip will take place in Bridgeton, New Jersey.  Our group will stay in a local school with 375 high schoolers from around the U.S.  They will be teamed up with 5 or 6 other youth and leaders &#8211; none of who will be from their own group &#8211; to go out each day and fix, repair and/or paint homes of those less fortunate.  At the end of the day they will experience dynamic youth worship services put together by Group.</p>

<p>This is a life-changing opportunity for the youth.  They will be stretched and need to have an attitude that will allow them to be stretched while growing in their faith and making new friends.  To participate in this trip the youth need to make a commitment to attend Solid Rock Youth regularly, participate in a Life 2gether group and participate in all fundraisers.</p>

<p><h2 id="wadventure">SRY Wilderness Adventure - Stephenville, Newfoundland</h2></p>

<p>Get ready for the adventure of a lifetime! Shoulder your pack, tie up your boots, and come explore one of the greatest wilderness areas east of the Rocky Mountains. You&#8217;ll get to see the wild in a way most have never done - on foot and completely self reliant using only what you can carry in your pack. You&#8217;ll be backpacking over 70km through the Blow-Me-Down mountains and into the rugged alpine of the Lewis Hills. There are no trails or signs. You&#8217;ll learn how to navigate using map, compass and GPS . You&#8217;ll camp surrounded by thousand foot high canyon walls and you&#8217;ll stand on the highest peak of Newfoundland&#8217;s Island giving you a 360 degree view that stretches for over a hundred kilometers! You&#8217;re guaranteed to see wildlife. Expect to see moose, caribou, arctic hare, eagles, and if you&#8217;re lucky some black bears!</p>

<p>You&#8217;ll begin learning the basics before we set foot in the wilderness: how to pack your backpack, how to set up a tent, how to light a stove, and how to stay warm. Once we get under way you&#8217;ll learn to master various backcountry skills both as an individual and with your group. By the end of the adventure you&#8217;ll have learned much of what is needed to travel the backcountry safely and without impact on the environment. </p>

<p>During this adventure in the wilderness, without the modern comforts of home, you will not only learn a great deal about backpacking skills, the ecosystem, and mountain weather, you&#8217;ll learn about yourself and the amazing things you can achieve. You&#8217;ll also have time to reflect on God&#8217;s creation and power as you experience it in a unique and life changing way. </p>

<p>Spend ten days this summer with SRY making new friends, learning new skills, and having the adventure of a lifetime!</p>

<p>I''ll try to answer this question in two parts: First of all, we know that it was Jesus'' mission to die for us (Matthew 20:28) so that our sins (what we''ve done wrong) would be able to be forgiven.</p>

<p>The fact that Jesus died on a cross had more to do with when he lived, where he lived, who ruled his country, and who put him to death. The Roman Empire ruled Jesus'' country at the time and crucifixion (death on a cross) was their method of killing people they considered to be the worst criminals. The cross was considered the most terrible form of death and public humiliation so the Romans used this as a way of keeping people in line. Even though Jesus was found innocent of breaking the law, the Romans still had him killed in this terrible way.</p>

<p>Secondly it should be understood that Jesus'' death on a cross was also God''s way of showing how very much he loves us. From the very beginning of the Bible it was predicted that God''s Son would come and rescue us from our sin. It was also understood that God''s Son would suffer and die in the rescue. Not only would God''s Son suffer but he would be publically humiliated, and suffer great shame. Read Psalm 22 and note all the amazing similarities to Jesus'' death (and written about 1,000 years before Jesus was born!). Jesus was suppost to die in a manner that was so shameful and painful that it would be obvious that only God''s love for us would have allowed it to happen this way.</p>', '2005-11-28 22:06:00', '2008-06-12 14:46:58.335637', 0, true, true, true, 'question1whydid', true);

<blockquote class="smalltext"><i>The industrial brewers continue to prosper; but now they are facing a new challenge from local brewers across the country who are dedicated to turning out brews that have only one thing in common with industrial beer - wetness.</i></blockquote><p><p>
JACK KEROUAC, OR MAYBE IT WAS HIS CHARACTER SAL PARADISE, once went in search of an ideal American bar - a quest that I have furthered, with results steadily diminishing, mostly because of the closing of many regional American breweries. Today only six companies brew 92 percent of American beer; Anheuser-Busch and Miller control more than half of the output, and by 1990, I read, they will have two thirds of domestic brewage. Now, if you consider Lite a beer - rather than, say, a beverage - or if Budweiser satisfies you, then you have no reason for concern. But if you desire beers regional and traditional, in these statistics you will see alarm. How can an ideal bar exist without genuine brews? Drinking Lite in a fine bar is like watching donkeyball at Wrigley Field.<p>A grand friend, a man of Scotch and Ojibway ancestry, whom I call The Venerable Tashmoo, had recently heard that an authentic traditional brew was available in Albany, New York, a city once notable for its ales. (While all ales are beer, the difference is that ale is made with a yeast that floats to the surface of the fermentation tank, whereas a lager yeast works on the bottom. Top-fermenting yeasts produce a fruity, even vinous, beer; lager, although aged longer than ale, has a more watery taste.) Our quest for a glass of good handmade began there, began in the industrial district not far from the Hudson River; in an old warehouse, a fellow, William Newman, had opened a tiny brewery in 1981, after learning the craft in England. He makes Newman''s Amber, Winter, and Pale ales in the traditional way, using only barley, water, hops, yeast. His annual production being fewer than 10,000 barrels (at thirty-one gallons each), Newman''s operation is a boutique, or micro-, brewery. Last year he hand-made some 4,600 barrels of beer, about what (by my figures) Anheuser-Busch pumps out in thirty minutes. <p>One September afternoon The Venerable and I watched Bill Newman work; we gnawed grains of his various malted barleys; we helped him stir the mash; we tasted the sweet wort, the hopped wort, the green beer, and the finished ale fresh from the maturing tank. Young Newman (to be a micro-brewer is to be under forty) wanted to give his city a choice of flavors, to fill a cranny that the industrial breweries left as they bought up regional companies. He wanted a beer distinctively local and good, worth the price of a visit, and he wanted to make everything himself rather than resorting to contract brewing, whereby a larger brewery turns out a beer according to a recipe  provided. Pennsylvania Pilsner, of Philadelphia, and Samuel Adams, of Boston, are contract brews, not micros. Newman also produces a contract lager, his Albany Amber Beer.<p>From Newman''s old warehouse The Venerable and I broadened our search for a good beer - beer of another time, we were coming to believe - to Rochester, New York, where the California Brew Haus serves more than 150 kinds of beer. We refreshed memories of domestic brews we hadn''t poured in months, like  Yuengling''s Porter and Ballantine India Pale Ale, and imports we''d never poured, from Norwegian Aass to Polish Zywiec. "Years ago," The Venerable said over an Old Peculier, "I ordered a corned-beef sandwich and a beer. ''What flavor?'' the waitress asked. That was the time when a brand was synonymous with an individual flavor." <p>In October we learned of a bar in Washington, D.C., in the basement of a hotel. The Brickskeller offered some 500 beers. Twice that winter we visited. Late on the second evening (Pfungstadter, Stingo, Gorilla, Leopard Deluxe, Bombardier, Double Dragon, Damm, and Zipfer Ur-typ behind us) The Venerable had just finished a Samuel Smith''s Taddy Porter from England and I a Smith''s Nut Brown Ale. The drying foam made strata inside our glasses.  Looking across the table at the other empty glasses, still splendidly layered, I said, "There''s the archaeology of the evening." <p>The Venerable, raising his glass as if hunting a small shard, added, "And impossible to accomplish with a night of insipid American brewage." At the next table a man pointed to his Cable Car Classic, and said, "Then you don''t know this one. Meet the West Coast. Meet the future of American brewing." That was the sentence that offered us a knowledge, like some people''s salvation, that forever brings joy and sorrow - the one when you have it, the other when you don''t. <p>Still, the quest might have turned out differently had I not misjudged the  climate of southeast Alaska and overloaded my backpack with downy apparel. I was on my way north to write a story about fishing and logging among the Tlingit and Haida Indians, and had stopped over in Seattle for an interview.  Walking, bent under my pack, down Madison Street toward the Alaska ferry slip, and needing to get from beneath my miscalculations, I passed the Mark Tobey Pub at dusk. With time to spare, I went in. It was what they call well appointed, right to the blackboard menu: Scotch eggs, smoked salmon, mushroom canapÃ©s, brandied bread pudding. On the tap handles shone brands I''d never seen: Redhook, Pyramid Pale, Bridgeport, Hale''s Pale American, Grant''s Imperial Stout. Because I liked the name, I ordered a Redhook and drank, dimly aware that a fellow next to me was watching. The beer rolled and jumped in my mouth, my head; it made me drink with palate, tongue, cheeks, nose, throat, and - according to the fellow next to me, Brian Milbrath - with my eyes.<p>"Well?" he said.<p>"An American brewed this?"<p>"Brewed in Seattle."<p>He understood my need to taste, to fight guzzling, to keep silent for the concentration. "I see you''re not a Wet Air or a Green Death man." "Wet Air" is the American light beer with an orthographic cuteness that, Milbrath believes, is its single claim to distinction. "Green Death" is the local term for a large-selling ale named after the grand Seattle volcano.  Milbrath told me that he was a "keg specialist," a man who installs and maintains beer-tap systems. While I sampled my way down the draft line, Milbrath listed the micro-breweries of the Northwest: Redhook, Kemper, Yakima, Hart, Hale''s, Kufnerbrau, all in Washington; Columbia River, Hillsdale, and Widmer, in Oregon; Sierra Nevada, Stanislaus, and Thousand Oaks, in northern California. Along the northern coast more were appearing.  <p>Throughout the region also were brewery pubs, and in San Francisco the micro-brewery that outgrew the term but retained its quality, Anchor Brewing Company. In Seattle, Cooper''s tavern had twenty-two taps, nineteen of them micro-brews; another, Jake O''Shaugnessey''s, had a shelf of more than a hundred bourbons and fifty single-malt scotches; a Seattle Safeway, of all places, sold more than forty roasts of coffee. Milbrath was explaining how Seattle, with its openness to new things, has become the city in America for serious beer explorations; the citizens like to taste what they pay for. Because even the vapors of the northwest coast, I concluded, have more color, flavor, and aroma than Wet Air, light beers do not sell as well here as in, say, Las Vegas. In Seattle it is hard to peddle a beer with the lone attribute of wetness.<p>The conversation drew a circle around us as if we were rolling dice.  Everybody, including one brewing chemist, had a charge to make against big beer companies. The group hooted down the patently loony ones, but on three there was a consensus: Industrial brewers are turning more and more to "heavy," or high-gravity, brewing, whereby beer is made with a strong  alcoholic content, only to be watered down before bottling. The "beechwood aging" advertised by Budweiser does not mean beer stored in wooden casks; rather, it refers to strips of wood thrown into the steel maturing tanks. Miller uses a seaweed extract, propylene glycol alginate, in Lite to try to provide something like taste; the extract leaves a residue on the tongue to hold a bit longer what little flavor there is. That last charge I could check, the chemist said, in a book called Chemical Additives in Booze, published by the Center for Science in the Public Interest.<p>I got a copy later and found these compounds listed for Miller Lite: the alginate (as a foam stabilizer, not as a taste enhancer), corn syrup, chemically modified hop extracts,  amyloglucosidase, papain enzyme, liquid sugar, potassium metabisulfite. I called the company. A spokesman, Bob Bertini, said, "We have no additives in our beers." I read the list to him. He said, "I won''t get into the items one by one, but there''s no way that list is factual. Beyond corn syrup, yeasts, hop extracts, and water, we don''t discuss our recipe for competitive reasons. We''re advertising purity now, because we saw a growing concern regarding any products with preservatives or additives. We haven''t changed our beers - we''ve changed our labels." I called the Center for Science in the Public Interest. They were no longer standing by their lists of ingredients, but they did send along an undated copy of a flyer from Anheuser-Busch that listed all of the ingredients supposedly in Miller Lite. This flyer was the basis for the Center''s list. Of three brewing chemists that I talked with, two believed most big brewers were no longer using additives. Where was the truth? I don''t know, but it was plain that the corporate warfare between the two largest American brewers had helped move some beer drinkers not away from one big brewer to another but rather away from industrial brewing altogether and toward an openness to try the beers of handcrafters who are working with only the four basic ingredients.<p>Before I got under my pack  again to leave for Alaska, I wrote a postcard to The Venerable: THE QUEST: NEXT STOP, PUGET SOUND.<p>A FEW MONTHS LATER THE VENERABLE AND I ARRIVED IN SEATTLE, on an English spring day, dim and damp - just the kind of weather for a small tap-house in the late afternoon. Cooper''s, although not the ideal bar, nevertheless has the feel of a fine old neighborhood place; it''s a tabernacle of handmade brews and side-order food. Despite the meathook softball teams that meet here to swill pitchers of Industrial Strength, the customers, even though young, generally know what should and should not be in a glass of beer.  Zymurgy is a serious topic. We had just sat down when over the television came boom-diddyboomboom . . . "Made the American way. . . No preservatives, no additives . . . purity you can see, quality you can taste." Someone called out a term for male bovine scat. To answer my stare, he said, repeating a common (but unproven) claim, "Clarity is not purity. You going to trust a company that manipulates its beer so that it can put it in clear bottles?"<p>While the city dripped, The Venerable and I sat snug and judged northwest handmade. He considered Bridgeport the best; we both deemed Pyramid Pale Ale, with its high hoppiness, a splendid thing; but I chose the whole line from the Redhook Ale Brewery: Redhook,  Blackhook Porter, Winterhook Ale, Ballard Bitter. I liked moving from one to another.<p>A man trying to save money - micro-beers are about half-again higher - ordered a Bud Light. The Venerable said, "Want to save money? Order a seltzer with lemon." The fellow did. Later my friend lectured a dieting woman: "Look, a Bud Light has three quarters the calories of a regular Bud.  Forty calories less is all. You know what forty calories is? Half a cup of soybean sprouts. Light beers are jokes as beer and hoaxes as dietetics."<p>I told the bartender what I''d seen at lunch in a cafe downtown: a man - fifties, blue blazer, penny loafers, USA Today under his arm - ordered a Hale''s Pale American Ale, took a single sip, and handed it back to the  bartender, who dumped it and then passed across a bottle of Heineken. The bartender said, "I don''t see many conversions of middle-aged people. The beer a man''s drinking when he''s thirty is the one he tends to believe in the rest of his life." <p> The Venerable, just beyond the half-century mark, said, "Then I should still be on old Wooden Shoe, of Minster, Ohio."<p>Over the course of the evening this notion emerged: The micro-brewers confront a generation of Second World War servicemen who learned beer from the 3.2 percent stuff in olive-drab cans. The GI came to believe that taste in beer, like taste in water, was to be feared. Now the small brewers face a younger generation brain-stunned by television advertising that has made the public want - even demand - just what the corporation wants to sell. They confront an American public that considers dieting to be a Pepsi Free with the french fries. And then there''s the higher cost of handmade over factory beer. Yet in Seattle, Portland, San Francisco, even in Boulder and Dallas, micro-brewers, if not nipping at the heels of the industrials, are at least  growling low in the corner. The next day The Venerable and I went off to a growler.<p>THE REDHOOK BREWERY IS IN A FORMER TRANSMISSION-REPAIR shop in Ballard, an old waterfront neighborhood of Seattle. Although the district is still kind of a seagoing place, it now also has galvanizing c ompanies and genetic-engineering labs. It stands with one leg in the past, one in the future - about the same position as the Redhook Brewing Company.<p>Paul Shipman, the president of the company, grew up in Philadelphia, graduated from Bucknell in English literature, received an M.B.A. from the University of Virginia, learned winemaking in Lancaster County, Pennsylvania, and, in the seventies, sold wine door to door as if it were so many Bibles. When he moved to Seattle, he worked first for a winery, even though he had long been passionate about beers of full flavor. He never gave any thought to improving wine, but he knew that American beers were open territory. Trips to England confirmed how far Americans had strayed from their earlier tradition, but, he told us, he "just couldn''t see any kind of business in beer." Then, in 1981, his friend Gordon Bowker, the chairman of Starbucks Coffee Company, gave him "a pitch" about opening a small brewery.  Shipman said, "The brewing industry showed signs of being ripe for a small entrepreneur." The mega-brewers, growing huge by acquiring smaller breweries or opening new plants, had such a lust for profit that they moved all of their beers toward the middle of public taste as they perceived it or wanted to perceive it. They made their lager-style beers even less flavorful when they saw they could sell slightly alcoholic soda water, a solution one micro-brewer calls "lawn-mower beer." The brewing process changed as zymurgy developed and a drive to lower the per-barrel cost began. Brewers found ways to control the highly erratic nature of beer, some of which involved chemical inducements. Shipman said, "The bigger the scale of operation, the safer a corporation wants to be. It moves toward the middle to avoid risk."<p>With the repeal of the Volstead Act, in 1933, only about half of the roughly 1,500 breweries that had existed previously resumed operation; by 1980 just twenty-two brewers remained. Even these numbers deceive: of the few, imperiled regional breweries hanging on, virtually all now imitate the industrial brewers by turning out Velveeta beer. The result? Budweiser, Miller, Stroh (the third largest brewer), have been able to wipe them up like so many wet spots on the bar. In the final step the industrials, as if using the science-fiction novel The Space Merchants as a guide, have manipulated the public taste, primarily through commercials, and made it serve their ends. But for one brewery in the mid-1970s, Schlitz, cutting costs and abbreviating brewing caused sales to drop by almost half in the five years before the Stroh Brewery Company bought it.<p>By the late 1970s retailers began to notice increasing requests for imported beer - never mind that imports are rarely the same here as they are in their native lands. Some people, their tastes awakened and maybe even informed by the various new American wines, looked unsuccessfully for variety in domestic beers. Others bought imports to strike back at corporations that tried, by controlling a retail shelf, to determine how the rest of us should live.<p>Shipman and Bowker noticed all this, and in August of 1982 they brewed their first batch of Redhook. Shipman says, "We wanted an individually crafted, top-fermented brew - a real ale, not a lager - and we wanted to use only the traditional ingredients of malted barley, hops, yeast, and water. We started with Redhook because we wanted a bold statement, an ale people would not confuse with something already available. If our brew had to be more expensive, then we had to give them a reason to change. We got that in Redhook. It''s the most radical beer in America."<p>Excluding some explosive accident that a home brewer might bring forth in his basement, Redhook is certainly the most radical-tasting beer in America. Joseph Owades, the brewing chemist who invented light beer, agrees. Beer drinkers who love it ("It''s why I drink beer") and those who hate it ("Right out of the cowshed") agree. "With Redhook," Bowker told me, "we polarized the market. Our success began with that." When Shipman and Bowker introduced the ale to Seattle, in the fall of 1982, the mayor publicly, grandly, tasted a glass, looked about, his eyes staggering, and said, "This is no quiche-eater''s beer.",<p>No eater of quiche is Rod Mason, six foot four, two hundred and fifty pounds, a former trooper in Britain''s Royal Horse Guards, Household Cavalry Regiment (the Queen''s guard). In that first Redhook autumn Mason owned the Guardsman Tavern, just north of the Redhook brewery, and he was a critic of the ale - that is, he considered it one of the few brews in America worth criticism. His grandfather, who once ran a pub in Gloucestershire, was a cellarman who knew how to treat beer: how to store it, tap it, serve it from clean taps. He taught Mason that special knowledge, and the grandson learned, he says, "from the cellar up." A brewer can make the finest beer in the land, but if the pub owner is careless, the customer might as well buy  slumgullion. At the Guardsman, Mason saw that Americans, tiring of industrial beers, were ready: "I knew the number of people who were happy with their beer was small, but they didn''t know where to turn. Then came Redhook. It was alarmingly inconsistent in those days of working out the  crinkles." Now the brewery employs Mason as a kind of ambassador of its new world of old-style beers. "The ales are finally perfected," he says. "They''re what we want them to be. If we get a bad batch now, we sewer the whole lot."<p>Inconsistency is both bane and boon to the micro-brewer; Americans, Mason thinks, want strict consistency in a brew, while Englishmen realize that small variations are proof of handcrafting, something more valuable than assembly-line sameness. Shipman says, "Redhook is going to be a slightly different taste every time you drink it. It doesn''t pretend to be consistent - I mean, precisely the same. That''s the real nature of an ale brewed in the traditional way."<p>Americans once drank top-fermented, English-style ales, full of color, flavor, aroma, and variation. In the mid-nineteenth century, newly arriving Middle Europeans (Busch, Schaefer, Schlitz, Pabst) brought along the German technique for making bottom-fermented lager. In the face of a newer method and aggressive salesmanship, older American brewing methods disappeared. Now micro-brewers find themselves educating Americans to that earlier tradition. Mason says, "Six years ago this country didn''t have any reference point for  tasting a real ale, and even today Americans are still edgy about the very word ale. The color of some ales intimidates them. Few people realize that the so-called ales produced by the large regional breweries are not true ales. The word has been terribly abused in this country."<p>I asked Shipman, "If George Washington, who was a lover of beer, were in Seattle today, which beer would he recognize?"<p> "I''d guess Redhook. It''s traditional - almost a barley wine, which Washington would know."<p>"Is the past the future here?"<p>"I believe we''re going to leave the lager age. It''s had its time, or at least its dominance. What we''ll see is both industrial beers and post-industrial products that are, because of the traditional brewing, actually pre-industrial brews. We''ll be here along with Budweiser, but I  don''t believe that Anheuser-Busch will begin making anything resembling a true ale. The economics are against it; the demand is still limited. But what you see with us is one more sign that smokestack America is dying. People aren''t in love with mass production any longer. We''re brand new, five years old, and already we''re brewing seven thousand barrels a year. In 1985 we grew by fifty percent and in 1986 by fifty-five percent. In 1990 we can be up to twenty-five thousand barrels. Anchor Brewing was an inspiration to us, and we can grow the way they have. We can get as big as our ability to stand the stress."<p>The stress lies in the touchy nature of ale brewing. When the top-fermenting yeasts go to work on the hopped wort, when they begin to shape the character of the brew, so to speak, it all happens rapidly - within a day or two. The critical time for a bottom-fermented lager may last two weeks. The brewmaster must decide quickly what to do with the fermentation, and on his decision company profits ride. The success of Redhook comes from good decisions in several places, none more critical than in the brewhouse; after all, a barrel of Winterhook is not a washing machine that can be sent back up the assembly line to have a gear replaced. It''s more like a jump shot in basketball: once the ball is off the fingertips, the character of its flight is decided.<p>It took nine thousand dollars and thirty-two days to clean the Redhook brewhouse of its transmission crud, but that once-oily floor became the point of departure for brews that helped change the way people perceive and drink beer in Seattle. Their building clean, the partners brought from Germany a stacked copper brew kettle so fine that it''s almost sculpture; all the equipage cost more than half a million dollars. Of the seven traditional  steps in brewing - malting, milling, mashing, boiling, fermenting, maturing, racking - Redhook does all but the first. Their entirely American malts - they use no extracts, as do some micros that start with the boiling - come from a maltster. Redhook adheres to a modern form of the Reinheitsgebot, the sixteenth-century Bavarian purity law - also observed in Germany - that said a brewer may use only barley, water, and hops; the part played by yeast, then unknown, has been recognized. No adjuncts of corn (grits, flakes,  starch), rice, sorghum, milo, or syrups, and no additives (chemical compounds). In this country it is legal for a brewery to introduce forty-eight additives and four adjuncts and still call its beer "pure." Several of the additives - foaming agents, head stabilizers, taste enhancers, colorings, anti-oxidants, emulsions - perhaps give industrial brewers reason not to list complete ingredients on their labels.<p>During our yeasty, malty explorations over the last months of our quest, The Venerable and I noticed an absence of hangovers, although on a couple of evenings we had edged, in the interest of complete reporting, toward immoderation. Although Rick Buchanan, the Redhook brewmaster, knows that not everyone agrees, he believes that "true ales tend to be less toxic (for lack of a better word) than lager yeasts that are fermented at improperly high temperatures to create an ale-like taste. The symptoms of alcohol poisoning come from fusel oil, and fermenting yeasts at higher temperatures than they are meant to be fermented, the way some industrial brewers might do, increases the oil." Maybe fusel-oil levels explain how a maid of honor in the court of Henry VIII withstood a three-gallon daily ale allowance.<p>When we went from the brewhouse into the conference room, Rod Mason pulled glasses of Winterhook for us. We appraised it; we sniffed and sipped, even tapped the firm head, composed of almost microscopic bubbles. The composition and durability of the froth are such useful indicators of quality that a Guinness patent on a beer tap has one single-spaced, legal-size page description of a proper head: it should be persistent from first sip to last, and its bubbles should be uniform, without randomness, and "possessed of minuteness."<p>At noon we drove to the Pacific Inn, a small eatery serving good grill food, to see what can happen between the racked keg and the tapped beer. Mason said, "Most taverns, even in Seattle, set their refrigeration for Miller or  Rainier, because those beers won''t pour warm. They turn to foam. But you won''t be able to taste a good ale at that temperature."<p>I remembered a combination gas station and bar in Georgia where a swagbellied fellow came to buy a bottle of beer. The proprietor asked what kind. "The kind that''s froze to the coils." <p>"Drinkers abuse what they can''t taste," Shipman said. "They drink too much  to compensate."<p>Mason said, "Our ales lend themselves to moderation because they''re flavorful. We gain customers by improving our beers. A big brewer can''t do that without raising costs, and that means losing customers. Factory beer gets locked into mediocrity." <p>While a good micro can take sales from industrial brewers with the individual character of its beers, it has to struggle for distribution. Because bottling is expensive and retail shelf space can be hard to get, Redhook waited two and a half years before beginning to bottle a small percentage of its brews as a first step toward reaching buyers beyond Seattle. Paul Shipman sees three courses for a micro-brewery: it can remain small and sell only locally (bottles or kegs), it can serve its beer only at the brewery, piping it directly from the maturation tank to the tap (the brew pub), or it can grow into a middle-sized regional brewery, as the Anchor Brewing Company has done.<p>IN SAN FRANCISCO THE ANCHOR BREWERY, ON POTRERO Hill, LOOKS onto old warehouses - one of them recently made into a mall - and tennis courts and the backs of half-century-old houses. As in Ballard, the past is cheek by jowl with the future. The Anchor building, a Depression piece, was once a Chase and Sanborn instant-coffee and pudding factory. Fritz Maytag, whose grandfather founded the Iowa washing-machine company, bought the old and foundering brewing company in 1965, and when he later moved it to these larger quarters, he had to sandblast the interior to get out the smell of roasted coffee. Now the brewhouse - its German kettles looking like great coppery onions, the brass fittings and knobs gleaming, the air full of hops and ferment - may be the most handsome in the country.<p>Maytag, a former literature student (a major he shares with newer brewers), reader of Thoreau, now a company president and brewmaster, told me, "I''m in the business of making beer that most people don''t like. They say when they taste it, ''What the hell is this?"'' Indigenous to San Francisco, steam brewing is a cross between English and German methods: a lager yeast is  fermented at higher, ale temperatures. The "steam" appears when the pressurized maturation tanks are opened and carbon dioxide hisses out. The company that Maytag bought brewed only draft beer, and that poorly. He began by improving its quality - using the best ingredients, taking more care,  reviving traditional ways. Then he started bottling. Later he added a porter (he wrote the recipe himself), then an ale and a Christmas brew, and, recently, a barley wine and a wheat beer. Eighty percent of the annual production of 38,000 barrels is Steam Beer, with Liberty Ale and the porter making up almost all of the other 20 percent.<p>Maytag brews the three newest, in tiny quantities, for several reasons, all of which come down to his love of beer. He says, "The Christmas ale is a brewer''s midwinter custom. It''s also a present to the people who support us, and it''s a way of reconnecting with the roots of a Christmas tradition. This year all the barley in our Christmas beer comes from one farm near Tule Lake, California. Our employees went up there for the harvest to see the source of what we make and to see our connections with nature - the risks in nature. As for barley wine, I make it because I believe in it. I came to love it when I studied brewing in England. Our Old Foghorn requires twice as much grain for half as much brew as an ordinary beer, it''s a nuisance to bottle, and it''s expensive to make. But barley wine is one of the most interesting drinks on earth, although it''s poorly understood and not much appreciated. It''s something to sip by the hearth. A contemplative drink. It''ll never have wide popularity, but I own the place and I can do what I like. A brewery should have a hallmark - a drink of absolute distinction. Old Foghorn will become ours. Wheat beer? I''ve said for years that it could have a big audience, and ours will. In a way, it''s the  opposite of Old Foghorn - it''s a hot-day, light drink. It''s our lawn-mower beer. "<p>Today only 10 percent of production is draft beer, all steam, and available only locally. But Anchor and Liberty are crossing the country in bottles. Last fall they even reached my town, in the middle of Missouri. Maytag says, "If micro means production under ten thousand barrels a year, then we were a micro for a decade. We''ve grown because what we make is true, traditional, honest, and good. We celebrate the materials for what they are." By that he means at least 80 percent of the mash is two-row barley in all of the brews, because, he believes, the cheaper, six-row variety used by the industrials gives a coarser beer. Maytag adds whole hop flowers - no hop pellets - at three different times and is willing to dump any batch that goes a bit awry. For the Liberty he uses a dry hopping that gives superb aroma and splendid taste. Nowhere an additive or adjunct. Anchor observes the Reinheitsgebot.<p>Maytag''s change to quality brought recognition, and the move to bottling brought a following. Today Anchor is the fastest-growing old-name brewery in the country, but, Maytag told us when The Venerable and I toured the brewhouse, the growth will stop at 50,000 barrels. "I won''t swear I''ll stop there, but one should have guidelines, a controlling principle. I like a business that''s small enough for the employees to see our interdependency."<p> Mark Carpenter, Anchor''s production manager, his white overalls turned to camouflage by yeast stains and penciled brewing times, said, "One of my fears is that Anheuser-Busch will start making a real ale. I''m afraid our growth will catch their eye. Maybe keeping our customers was easier when people laughed at something called steam beer." The anxiety is whimsical.  Makers of traditional brews know that the market for wet-air beers will remain large.<p>When we came out of the Anchor brewhouse and headed toward the tasting room, Joseph Owades stepped around the corner. Incredibly, here he stood - the father of Wet Air, the arch-Satan, Old Scratch incarnate. The Venerable alleges that once my surprise passed, I began tapping about my belt, as if feeling for a sidearm. Within reach stood the man who did in American beer. I asked why he did it.<p>Owades - suited and vested without flaw, a trim man with a clipped moustache - was there because he had just finished teaching his seminar "All About Beer" there. The biochemist was the first Ph.D. in the American brewing industry, writing his dissertation on cholesterol; he went to work for  Fleischmann''s Yeast, where he became interested in the microbial action of yeasts. Later he joined the Rheingold Brewery, in New York City, and became fascinated with taking out "calories that beer doesn''t need." He believed that people resisted drinking beer for two reasons, taste and fear of weight gain, So, after much research, he wrote a recipe that reduced calories and "lightened" even further the mild taste of lager. Owades told me, "Lowering carbohydrates - calories - also lowers the mouth feel. The analogy''s not  exact, but a regular beer stays on the tongue like ice cream; a light slides off like a sherbet. That changes taste."<p>Rheingold produced the first light recipe, under the name of Gablinger. Soon the secret to a low-calorie beer - the enzyme amyloglucosidase - was out. After Philip Morris Companies took over Miller Brewing, the corporation bought the rights to the name Lite from the MeisterBrau Brewing Company and let go with the advertising. American beer drinking hasn''t been the same since. "What can you expect," The Venerable said, "when a tobacco company gets into brewing?"<p>I asked Owades what beer he drinks. "Since I live in San Francisco now, I usually drink Anchor Steam." I asked if his research had made him wealthy. "I got my usual monthly salary."<p>Not to atone for light beer but because he was hired, Owades wrote the generally respected recipe for the East Coast brew New Amsterdam Amber.<p>"Tell me," The Venerable asked, "can you tell the difference between, say, a Budweiser and a Coors?"<p>"All major American beers are structurally very similar. No, after two beers I won''t be able to tell the difference between a Budweiser and a Coors, but with an Anchor Steam and a Redhook, I could distinguish them after a half dozen. It''s true that micro-brewers are broadening the spectrum, but you''ll see a lot of them fail, because brewing''s hard work, and what they produce just isn''t good. But for the best ones, a metropolitan area will support them."<p>MICRO-BREWERY FAILURES SO FAR HAVE COME MORE FROM undercapitalization than from poor brew. The New Albion Brewing Company, of Sonoma, California, the first true American micro, went under because it began bottling before it was financially able to produce beer in quantity. In distribution Jonah must face the leviathan. An industrial brewer can make distribution very difficult for a small brewer (sometimes by illegal means). One solution: eliminate distribution altogether by running beer from the maturation tank to the customer''s glass, or, as The Venerable said, "Put the cat under the milk cow." In this country brew pubs are still scarce, but in colonial America a traveler could find tavern after tavern serving its own beer.<p>The brew pub also provides the owner with complete control over his ales and lagers, an important consideration when excellence is the aim. No other alcoholic beverage is so sensitive, so perishable, as beer. It will change from towel lint in the glass, from a refrigerator five degrees off, from sitting in a glass on a waiter''s tray an extra two minutes, on and on.  Virtually everything that is not beer is its enemy.<p>In Hayward, California, on the lower east side of San Francisco Bay, The Venerable and I went to Buffalo Bill''s Brewpub, where Bill Owens, the owner, said, "The wave is the brew pub, and I''m on the crest." His influential book of photographs titled Suburbia brought him a Guggenheim fellowship in 1976.<p>Then he published Our Kind of People and, later, Working: Or I Do It for the Money. The books earned him little more than respect. Owens said, "Photojournalism had peaked. I got in on the dying days, the back end. Now I''m in on the front end of something. Now I can write checks faster than they bounce. In ten years there''ll be a hundred brew pubs in the United States, and you''ll see me in Fortune. Instead of shooting assignments on colored popcorn for them, 1''11 be the subject. That''s the difference between back ends and front ends."<p>Owens began brewing a few gallons at home in the early seventies. At his fortieth-birthday party, in 1978, a friend said, "Let''s open a brewery." They looked at a couple of micros and decided that a bottling line was too expensive and too complex, and so they abandoned the idea. (They do, however, bottle for takeout.) Then, the next year, they heard about brew pubs, revolting against the Americanization of British beer-making, that were opening all across Britain. In 1983, when the brew pub became legal in California, Owens set up a limited partnership, sold twenty-seven shares, and raised $110,000. "A good idea sells much easier and for more money than a good photograph." He rented an old downtown building, once a camera store, gutted it, and built a tiny brewhouse in the back with a picture window to allow the customer to sit, sip, and see his brew made. He tore up the floor and laid sixty-two feet of pipe from the brewroom to the bar with the help of an investor who works on nuclear bombs. That sixty-two feet is his distribution system; it, as much as anything else, allows him to compete with the industrials. By scrounging equipment from a candy company, a food  manufacturer, and a dairy, he assembled his brewing apparatus for $35,000.  On September 9, 1983, he opened the third brew pub in the United States. The first batch of Buffalo Bill he made went on sale, and today he''s unsure whether he''s ever dumped anything even if he should have. A customer told me, "That early stuff was out of the buffalo''s posterior. It had hoofs and horns in it. Now he''s about perfected it. I''m a fixture here, part of the pipeline."<p>Owens brews six barrels every Monday, about three hundred barrels a year. "For a hundred and thirty dollars'' worth of ingredients I can make a twenty-five-hundred-dollar profit. A glass of lager - that''s all I brew now - costs seven cents. I sell it for a dollar and a half. Compare my profit on a bottle of commercial beer - forty cents." Last year half of his $200,000 gross income came from Buffalo Bill Beer, the rest from sandwiches and other beers. <p>He wrote a book titled How to Build a Small Brewery, which he sells over the bar and by mail, and he bought up two home-brewing magazines and consolidated them into a quarterly, American Brewer. Owens told The  Venerable and me, "It doesn''t bring in money so much as it puts me on the map as a pioneer. It keeps me in touch with people in the industry."<p> With plans to open two more places in 1988, he''s trademarked the term Brewpub in California. He wants a half dozen pubs, some in malls, with the brewhouse in the front window to lure in strollers. He wants to franchise.<p>"My fun is promoting. If the television camera is here, I get out my big paddle and stir the mash. It''s not necessary to stir. It''s just graphic. Look, everybody wants to be an entrepreneur now. I''m on the edge of the revolution - the making-money-and-enjoying-it revolution. A lot of micro-brewers are purists. Ale is the Holy Grail. I''m not interested in that. You find chemists and chefs - I''m a chef. I know my truth is best. I do it the easy way. I boil for an hour because my timer runs for an hour. I use pellet hops, but I don''t use malt extracts and I don''t filter. My water is snowmelt from the mountains, just like Anchor''s. But I don''t care if Americans don''t know what ale is. I don''t care if they''re afraid of it. I know that light rum outsells dark rum three to one, and I know that Americans want their beer cold, clarified, and carbonated. I don''t make an  ale, and I can''t waste my time educating Americans about ale. It''s not my job. I''m interested in making my own kind of beer. This isn''t Burger King. You can''t have it your way. You get it my way. I work by one rule: Don''t get complicated. Don''t build a Rolls-Royce factory to make a go-cart. There''s one other rule: Take the profit off the top."<p>The Venerable, always ready to play advocate for the devil, asked, "Would you say that you emphasize the style of dispensing over the product?" "The style brings a customer in, but it''s the beer that has to bring him back."<p> South of Sacramento, near Interstate 5, we stopped in a bar overhung with ferns, stained glass, old-time signs. We went in looking not for the perfect bar but only for a working phone. We knew that men who discuss the bubbles in a head of beer, who read patterns in the Irish lace - those men do not come into bars like this. Yet we had a small hope that some bottle of an untried oddity might be tucked away. The offerings, of course, were Hobson''s choice. Maybe the wish to put a touchstone to these last days of golden glasses urged us, I don''t know, but we ordered our Hobson''s, our industrial.  The Venerable lifted his glass, drank, and set it down. He turned to me blankly and said, "Did I miss my mouth?"<p><blockquote class="smalltext"><i><br>via <a href="http://www.wesjones.com/moon1.htm">http://www.wesjones.com/moon1.htm</a><p><p>

<blockquote class="smalltext"><i>The industrial brewers continue to prosper; but now they are facing a new challenge from local brewers across the country who are dedicated to turning out brews that have only one thing in common with industrial beer - wetness.</i></blockquote><p><p>
JACK KEROUAC, OR MAYBE IT WAS HIS CHARACTER SAL PARADISE, once went in search of an ideal American bar - a quest that I have furthered, with results steadily diminishing, mostly because of the closing of many regional American breweries. Today only six companies brew 92 percent of American beer; Anheuser-Busch and Miller control more than half of the output, and by 1990, I read, they will have two thirds of domestic brewage. Now, if you consider Lite a beer - rather than, say, a beverage - or if Budweiser satisfies you, then you have no reason for concern. But if you desire beers regional and traditional, in these statistics you will see alarm. How can an ideal bar exist without genuine brews? Drinking Lite in a fine bar is like watching donkeyball at Wrigley Field.<p>A grand friend, a man of Scotch and Ojibway ancestry, whom I call The Venerable Tashmoo, had recently heard that an authentic traditional brew was available in Albany, New York, a city once notable for its ales. (While all ales are beer, the difference is that ale is made with a yeast that floats to the surface of the fermentation tank, whereas a lager yeast works on the bottom. Top-fermenting yeasts produce a fruity, even vinous, beer; lager, although aged longer than ale, has a more watery taste.) Our quest for a glass of good handmade began there, began in the industrial district not far from the Hudson River; in an old warehouse, a fellow, William Newman, had opened a tiny brewery in 1981, after learning the craft in England. He makes Newman''s Amber, Winter, and Pale ales in the traditional way, using only barley, water, hops, yeast. His annual production being fewer than 10,000 barrels (at thirty-one gallons each), Newman''s operation is a boutique, or micro-, brewery. Last year he hand-made some 4,600 barrels of beer, about what (by my figures) Anheuser-Busch pumps out in thirty minutes. <p>One September afternoon The Venerable and I watched Bill Newman work; we gnawed grains of his various malted barleys; we helped him stir the mash; we tasted the sweet wort, the hopped wort, the green beer, and the finished ale fresh from the maturing tank. Young Newman (to be a micro-brewer is to be under forty) wanted to give his city a choice of flavors, to fill a cranny that the industrial breweries left as they bought up regional companies. He wanted a beer distinctively local and good, worth the price of a visit, and he wanted to make everything himself rather than resorting to contract brewing, whereby a larger brewery turns out a beer according to a recipe  provided. Pennsylvania Pilsner, of Philadelphia, and Samuel Adams, of Boston, are contract brews, not micros. Newman also produces a contract lager, his Albany Amber Beer.<p>From Newman''s old warehouse The Venerable and I broadened our search for a good beer - beer of another time, we were coming to believe - to Rochester, New York, where the California Brew Haus serves more than 150 kinds of beer. We refreshed memories of domestic brews we hadn''t poured in months, like  Yuengling''s Porter and Ballantine India Pale Ale, and imports we''d never poured, from Norwegian Aass to Polish Zywiec. "Years ago," The Venerable said over an Old Peculier, "I ordered a corned-beef sandwich and a beer. ''What flavor?'' the waitress asked. That was the time when a brand was synonymous with an individual flavor." <p>In October we learned of a bar in Washington, D.C., in the basement of a hotel. The Brickskeller offered some 500 beers. Twice that winter we visited. Late on the second evening (Pfungstadter, Stingo, Gorilla, Leopard Deluxe, Bombardier, Double Dragon, Damm, and Zipfer Ur-typ behind us) The Venerable had just finished a Samuel Smith''s Taddy Porter from England and I a Smith''s Nut Brown Ale. The drying foam made strata inside our glasses.  Looking across the table at the other empty glasses, still splendidly layered, I said, "There''s the archaeology of the evening." <p>The Venerable, raising his glass as if hunting a small shard, added, "And impossible to accomplish with a night of insipid American brewage." At the next table a man pointed to his Cable Car Classic, and said, "Then you don''t know this one. Meet the West Coast. Meet the future of American brewing." That was the sentence that offered us a knowledge, like some people''s salvation, that forever brings joy and sorrow - the one when you have it, the other when you don''t. <p>Still, the quest might have turned out differently had I not misjudged the  climate of southeast Alaska and overloaded my backpack with downy apparel. I was on my way north to write a story about fishing and logging among the Tlingit and Haida Indians, and had stopped over in Seattle for an interview.  Walking, bent under my pack, down Madison Street toward the Alaska ferry slip, and needing to get from beneath my miscalculations, I passed the Mark Tobey Pub at dusk. With time to spare, I went in. It was what they call well appointed, right to the blackboard menu: Scotch eggs, smoked salmon, mushroom canapÃ©s, brandied bread pudding. On the tap handles shone brands I''d never seen: Redhook, Pyramid Pale, Bridgeport, Hale''s Pale American, Grant''s Imperial Stout. Because I liked the name, I ordered a Redhook and drank, dimly aware that a fellow next to me was watching. The beer rolled and jumped in my mouth, my head; it made me drink with palate, tongue, cheeks, nose, throat, and - according to the fellow next to me, Brian Milbrath - with my eyes.<p>"Well?" he said.<p>"An American brewed this?"<p>"Brewed in Seattle."<p>He understood my need to taste, to fight guzzling, to keep silent for the concentration. "I see you''re not a Wet Air or a Green Death man." "Wet Air" is the American light beer with an orthographic cuteness that, Milbrath believes, is its single claim to distinction. "Green Death" is the local term for a large-selling ale named after the grand Seattle volcano.  Milbrath told me that he was a "keg specialist," a man who installs and maintains beer-tap systems. While I sampled my way down the draft line, Milbrath listed the micro-breweries of the Northwest: Redhook, Kemper, Yakima, Hart, Hale''s, Kufnerbrau, all in Washington; Columbia River, Hillsdale, and Widmer, in Oregon; Sierra Nevada, Stanislaus, and Thousand Oaks, in northern California. Along the northern coast more were appearing.  <p>Throughout the region also were brewery pubs, and in San Francisco the micro-brewery that outgrew the term but retained its quality, Anchor Brewing Company. In Seattle, Cooper''s tavern had twenty-two taps, nineteen of them micro-brews; another, Jake O''Shaugnessey''s, had a shelf of more than a hundred bourbons and fifty single-malt scotches; a Seattle Safeway, of all places, sold more than forty roasts of coffee. Milbrath was explaining how Seattle, with its openness to new things, has become the city in America for serious beer explorations; the citizens like to taste what they pay for. Because even the vapors of the northwest coast, I concluded, have more color, flavor, and aroma than Wet Air, light beers do not sell as well here as in, say, Las Vegas. In Seattle it is hard to peddle a beer with the lone attribute of wetness.<p>The conversation drew a circle around us as if we were rolling dice.  Everybody, including one brewing chemist, had a charge to make against big beer companies. The group hooted down the patently loony ones, but on three there was a consensus: Industrial brewers are turning more and more to "heavy," or high-gravity, brewing, whereby beer is made with a strong  alcoholic content, only to be watered down before bottling. The "beechwood aging" advertised by Budweiser does not mean beer stored in wooden casks; rather, it refers to strips of wood thrown into the steel maturing tanks. Miller uses a seaweed extract, propylene glycol alginate, in Lite to try to provide something like taste; the extract leaves a residue on the tongue to hold a bit longer what little flavor there is. That last charge I could check, the chemist said, in a book called Chemical Additives in Booze, published by the Center for Science in the Public Interest.<p>I got a copy later and found these compounds listed for Miller Lite: the alginate (as a foam stabilizer, not as a taste enhancer), corn syrup, chemically modified hop extracts,  amyloglucosidase, papain enzyme, liquid sugar, potassium metabisulfite. I called the company. A spokesman, Bob Bertini, said, "We have no additives in our beers." I read the list to him. He said, "I won''t get into the items one by one, but there''s no way that list is factual. Beyond corn syrup, yeasts, hop extracts, and water, we don''t discuss our recipe for competitive reasons. We''re advertising purity now, because we saw a growing concern regarding any products with preservatives or additives. We haven''t changed our beers - we''ve changed our labels." I called the Center for Science in the Public Interest. They were no longer standing by their lists of ingredients, but they did send along an undated copy of a flyer from Anheuser-Busch that listed all of the ingredients supposedly in Miller Lite. This flyer was the basis for the Center''s list. Of three brewing chemists that I talked with, two believed most big brewers were no longer using additives. Where was the truth? I don''t know, but it was plain that the corporate warfare between the two largest American brewers had helped move some beer drinkers not away from one big brewer to another but rather away from industrial brewing altogether and toward an openness to try the beers of handcrafters who are working with only the four basic ingredients.<p>Before I got under my pack  again to leave for Alaska, I wrote a postcard to The Venerable: THE QUEST: NEXT STOP, PUGET SOUND.<p>A FEW MONTHS LATER THE VENERABLE AND I ARRIVED IN SEATTLE, on an English spring day, dim and damp - just the kind of weather for a small tap-house in the late afternoon. Cooper''s, although not the ideal bar, nevertheless has the feel of a fine old neighborhood place; it''s a tabernacle of handmade brews and side-order food. Despite the meathook softball teams that meet here to swill pitchers of Industrial Strength, the customers, even though young, generally know what should and should not be in a glass of beer.  Zymurgy is a serious topic. We had just sat down when over the television came boom-diddyboomboom . . . "Made the American way. . . No preservatives, no additives . . . purity you can see, quality you can taste." Someone called out a term for male bovine scat. To answer my stare, he said, repeating a common (but unproven) claim, "Clarity is not purity. You going to trust a company that manipulates its beer so that it can put it in clear bottles?"<p>While the city dripped, The Venerable and I sat snug and judged northwest handmade. He considered Bridgeport the best; we both deemed Pyramid Pale Ale, with its high hoppiness, a splendid thing; but I chose the whole line from the Redhook Ale Brewery: Redhook,  Blackhook Porter, Winterhook Ale, Ballard Bitter. I liked moving from one to another.<p>A man trying to save money - micro-beers are about half-again higher - ordered a Bud Light. The Venerable said, "Want to save money? Order a seltzer with lemon." The fellow did. Later my friend lectured a dieting woman: "Look, a Bud Light has three quarters the calories of a regular Bud.  Forty calories less is all. You know what forty calories is? Half a cup of soybean sprouts. Light beers are jokes as beer and hoaxes as dietetics."<p>I told the bartender what I''d seen at lunch in a cafe downtown: a man - fifties, blue blazer, penny loafers, USA Today under his arm - ordered a Hale''s Pale American Ale, took a single sip, and handed it back to the  bartender, who dumped it and then passed across a bottle of Heineken. The bartender said, "I don''t see many conversions of middle-aged people. The beer a man''s drinking when he''s thirty is the one he tends to believe in the rest of his life." <p> The Venerable, just beyond the half-century mark, said, "Then I should still be on old Wooden Shoe, of Minster, Ohio."<p>Over the course of the evening this notion emerged: The micro-brewers confront a generation of Second World War servicemen who learned beer from the 3.2 percent stuff in olive-drab cans. The GI came to believe that taste in beer, like taste in water, was to be feared. Now the small brewers face a younger generation brain-stunned by television advertising that has made the public want - even demand - just what the corporation wants to sell. They confront an American public that considers dieting to be a Pepsi Free with the french fries. And then there''s the higher cost of handmade over factory beer. Yet in Seattle, Portland, San Francisco, even in Boulder and Dallas, micro-brewers, if not nipping at the heels of the industrials, are at least  growling low in the corner. The next day The Venerable and I went off to a growler.<p>THE REDHOOK BREWERY IS IN A FORMER TRANSMISSION-REPAIR shop in Ballard, an old waterfront neighborhood of Seattle. Although the district is still kind of a seagoing place, it now also has galvanizing c ompanies and genetic-engineering labs. It stands with one leg in the past, one in the future - about the same position as the Redhook Brewing Company.<p>Paul Shipman, the president of the company, grew up in Philadelphia, graduated from Bucknell in English literature, received an M.B.A. from the University of Virginia, learned winemaking in Lancaster County, Pennsylvania, and, in the seventies, sold wine door to door as if it were so many Bibles. When he moved to Seattle, he worked first for a winery, even though he had long been passionate about beers of full flavor. He never gave any thought to improving wine, but he knew that American beers were open territory. Trips to England confirmed how far Americans had strayed from their earlier tradition, but, he told us, he "just couldn''t see any kind of business in beer." Then, in 1981, his friend Gordon Bowker, the chairman of Starbucks Coffee Company, gave him "a pitch" about opening a small brewery.  Shipman said, "The brewing industry showed signs of being ripe for a small entrepreneur." The mega-brewers, growing huge by acquiring smaller breweries or opening new plants, had such a lust for profit that they moved all of their beers toward the middle of public taste as they perceived it or wanted to perceive it. They made their lager-style beers even less flavorful when they saw they could sell slightly alcoholic soda water, a solution one micro-brewer calls "lawn-mower beer." The brewing process changed as zymurgy developed and a drive to lower the per-barrel cost began. Brewers found ways to control the highly erratic nature of beer, some of which involved chemical inducements. Shipman said, "The bigger the scale of operation, the safer a corporation wants to be. It moves toward the middle to avoid risk."<p>With the repeal of the Volstead Act, in 1933, only about half of the roughly 1,500 breweries that had existed previously resumed operation; by 1980 just twenty-two brewers remained. Even these numbers deceive: of the few, imperiled regional breweries hanging on, virtually all now imitate the industrial brewers by turning out Velveeta beer. The result? Budweiser, Miller, Stroh (the third largest brewer), have been able to wipe them up like so many wet spots on the bar. In the final step the industrials, as if using the science-fiction novel The Space Merchants as a guide, have manipulated the public taste, primarily through commercials, and made it serve their ends. But for one brewery in the mid-1970s, Schlitz, cutting costs and abbreviating brewing caused sales to drop by almost half in the five years before the Stroh Brewery Company bought it.<p>By the late 1970s retailers began to notice increasing requests for imported beer - never mind that imports are rarely the same here as they are in their native lands. Some people, their tastes awakened and maybe even informed by the various new American wines, looked unsuccessfully for variety in domestic beers. Others bought imports to strike back at corporations that tried, by controlling a retail shelf, to determine how the rest of us should live.<p>Shipman and Bowker noticed all this, and in August of 1982 they brewed their first batch of Redhook. Shipman says, "We wanted an individually crafted, top-fermented brew - a real ale, not a lager - and we wanted to use only the traditional ingredients of malted barley, hops, yeast, and water. We started with Redhook because we wanted a bold statement, an ale people would not confuse with something already available. If our brew had to be more expensive, then we had to give them a reason to change. We got that in Redhook. It''s the most radical beer in America."<p>Excluding some explosive accident that a home brewer might bring forth in his basement, Redhook is certainly the most radical-tasting beer in America. Joseph Owades, the brewing chemist who invented light beer, agrees. Beer drinkers who love it ("It''s why I drink beer") and those who hate it ("Right out of the cowshed") agree. "With Redhook," Bowker told me, "we polarized the market. Our success began with that." When Shipman and Bowker introduced the ale to Seattle, in the fall of 1982, the mayor publicly, grandly, tasted a glass, looked about, his eyes staggering, and said, "This is no quiche-eater''s beer.",<p>No eater of quiche is Rod Mason, six foot four, two hundred and fifty pounds, a former trooper in Britain''s Royal Horse Guards, Household Cavalry Regiment (the Queen''s guard). In that first Redhook autumn Mason owned the Guardsman Tavern, just north of the Redhook brewery, and he was a critic of the ale - that is, he considered it one of the few brews in America worth criticism. His grandfather, who once ran a pub in Gloucestershire, was a cellarman who knew how to treat beer: how to store it, tap it, serve it from clean taps. He taught Mason that special knowledge, and the grandson learned, he says, "from the cellar up." A brewer can make the finest beer in the land, but if the pub owner is careless, the customer might as well buy  slumgullion. At the Guardsman, Mason saw that Americans, tiring of industrial beers, were ready: "I knew the number of people who were happy with their beer was small, but they didn''t know where to turn. Then came Redhook. It was alarmingly inconsistent in those days of working out the  crinkles." Now the brewery employs Mason as a kind of ambassador of its new world of old-style beers. "The ales are finally perfected," he says. "They''re what we want them to be. If we get a bad batch now, we sewer the whole lot."<p>Inconsistency is both bane and boon to the micro-brewer; Americans, Mason thinks, want strict consistency in a brew, while Englishmen realize that small variations are proof of handcrafting, something more valuable than assembly-line sameness. Shipman says, "Redhook is going to be a slightly different taste every time you drink it. It doesn''t pretend to be consistent - I mean, precisely the same. That''s the real nature of an ale brewed in the traditional way."<p>Americans once drank top-fermented, English-style ales, full of color, flavor, aroma, and variation. In the mid-nineteenth century, newly arriving Middle Europeans (Busch, Schaefer, Schlitz, Pabst) brought along the German technique for making bottom-fermented lager. In the face of a newer method and aggressive salesmanship, older American brewing methods disappeared. Now micro-brewers find themselves educating Americans to that earlier tradition. Mason says, "Six years ago this country didn''t have any reference point for  tasting a real ale, and even today Americans are still edgy about the very word ale. The color of some ales intimidates them. Few people realize that the so-called ales produced by the large regional breweries are not true ales. The word has been terribly abused in this country."<p>I asked Shipman, "If George Washington, who was a lover of beer, were in Seattle today, which beer would he recognize?"<p> "I''d guess Redhook. It''s traditional - almost a barley wine, which Washington would know."<p>"Is the past the future here?"<p>"I believe we''re going to leave the lager age. It''s had its time, or at least its dominance. What we''ll see is both industrial beers and post-industrial products that are, because of the traditional brewing, actually pre-industrial brews. We''ll be here along with Budweiser, but I  don''t believe that Anheuser-Busch will begin making anything resembling a true ale. The economics are against it; the demand is still limited. But what you see with us is one more sign that smokestack America is dying. People aren''t in love with mass production any longer. We''re brand new, five years old, and already we''re brewing seven thousand barrels a year. In 1985 we grew by fifty percent and in 1986 by fifty-five percent. In 1990 we can be up to twenty-five thousand barrels. Anchor Brewing was an inspiration to us, and we can grow the way they have. We can get as big as our ability to stand the stress."<p>The stress lies in the touchy nature of ale brewing. When the top-fermenting yeasts go to work on the hopped wort, when they begin to shape the character of the brew, so to speak, it all happens rapidly - within a day or two. The critical time for a bottom-fermented lager may last two weeks. The brewmaster must decide quickly what to do with the fermentation, and on his decision company profits ride. The success of Redhook comes from good decisions in several places, none more critical than in the brewhouse; after all, a barrel of Winterhook is not a washing machine that can be sent back up the assembly line to have a gear replaced. It''s more like a jump shot in basketball: once the ball is off the fingertips, the character of its flight is decided.<p>It took nine thousand dollars and thirty-two days to clean the Redhook brewhouse of its transmission crud, but that once-oily floor became the point of departure for brews that helped change the way people perceive and drink beer in Seattle. Their building clean, the partners brought from Germany a stacked copper brew kettle so fine that it''s almost sculpture; all the equipage cost more than half a million dollars. Of the seven traditional  steps in brewing - malting, milling, mashing, boiling, fermenting, maturing, racking - Redhook does all but the first. Their entirely American malts - they use no extracts, as do some micros that start with the boiling - come from a maltster. Redhook adheres to a modern form of the Reinheitsgebot, the sixteenth-century Bavarian purity law - also observed in Germany - that said a brewer may use only barley, water, and hops; the part played by yeast, then unknown, has been recognized. No adjuncts of corn (grits, flakes,  starch), rice, sorghum, milo, or syrups, and no additives (chemical compounds). In this country it is legal for a brewery to introduce forty-eight additives and four adjuncts and still call its beer "pure." Several of the additives - foaming agents, head stabilizers, taste enhancers, colorings, anti-oxidants, emulsions - perhaps give industrial brewers reason not to list complete ingredients on their labels.<p>During our yeasty, malty explorations over the last months of our quest, The Venerable and I noticed an absence of hangovers, although on a couple of evenings we had edged, in the interest of complete reporting, toward immoderation. Although Rick Buchanan, the Redhook brewmaster, knows that not everyone agrees, he believes that "true ales tend to be less toxic (for lack of a better word) than lager yeasts that are fermented at improperly high temperatures to create an ale-like taste. The symptoms of alcohol poisoning come from fusel oil, and fermenting yeasts at higher temperatures than they are meant to be fermented, the way some industrial brewers might do, increases the oil." Maybe fusel-oil levels explain how a maid of honor in the court of Henry VIII withstood a three-gallon daily ale allowance.<p>When we went from the brewhouse into the conference room, Rod Mason pulled glasses of Winterhook for us. We appraised it; we sniffed and sipped, even tapped the firm head, composed of almost microscopic bubbles. The composition and durability of the froth are such useful indicators of quality that a Guinness patent on a beer tap has one single-spaced, legal-size page description of a proper head: it should be persistent from first sip to last, and its bubbles should be uniform, without randomness, and "possessed of minuteness."<p>At noon we drove to the Pacific Inn, a small eatery serving good grill food, to see what can happen between the racked keg and the tapped beer. Mason said, "Most taverns, even in Seattle, set their refrigeration for Miller or  Rainier, because those beers won''t pour warm. They turn to foam. But you won''t be able to taste a good ale at that temperature."<p>I remembered a combination gas station and bar in Georgia where a swagbellied fellow came to buy a bottle of beer. The proprietor asked what kind. "The kind that''s froze to the coils." <p>"Drinkers abuse what they can''t taste," Shipman said. "They drink too much  to compensate."<p>Mason said, "Our ales lend themselves to moderation because they''re flavorful. We gain customers by improving our beers. A big brewer can''t do that without raising costs, and that means losing customers. Factory beer gets locked into mediocrity." <p>While a good micro can take sales from industrial brewers with the individual character of its beers, it has to struggle for distribution. Because bottling is expensive and retail shelf space can be hard to get, Redhook waited two and a half years before beginning to bottle a small percentage of its brews as a first step toward reaching buyers beyond Seattle. Paul Shipman sees three courses for a micro-brewery: it can remain small and sell only locally (bottles or kegs), it can serve its beer only at the brewery, piping it directly from the maturation tank to the tap (the brew pub), or it can grow into a middle-sized regional brewery, as the Anchor Brewing Company has done.<p>IN SAN FRANCISCO THE ANCHOR BREWERY, ON POTRERO Hill, LOOKS onto old warehouses - one of them recently made into a mall - and tennis courts and the backs of half-century-old houses. As in Ballard, the past is cheek by jowl with the future. The Anchor building, a Depression piece, was once a Chase and Sanborn instant-coffee and pudding factory. Fritz Maytag, whose grandfather founded the Iowa washing-machine company, bought the old and foundering brewing company in 1965, and when he later moved it to these larger quarters, he had to sandblast the interior to get out the smell of roasted coffee. Now the brewhouse - its German kettles looking like great coppery onions, the brass fittings and knobs gleaming, the air full of hops and ferment - may be the most handsome in the country.<p>Maytag, a former literature student (a major he shares with newer brewers), reader of Thoreau, now a company president and brewmaster, told me, "I''m in the business of making beer that most people don''t like. They say when they taste it, ''What the hell is this?"'' Indigenous to San Francisco, steam brewing is a cross between English and German methods: a lager yeast is  fermented at higher, ale temperatures. The "steam" appears when the pressurized maturation tanks are opened and carbon dioxide hisses out. The company that Maytag bought brewed only draft beer, and that poorly. He began by improving its quality - using the best ingredients, taking more care,  reviving traditional ways. Then he started bottling. Later he added a porter (he wrote the recipe himself), then an ale and a Christmas brew, and, recently, a barley wine and a wheat beer. Eighty percent of the annual production of 38,000 barrels is Steam Beer, with Liberty Ale and the porter making up almost all of the other 20 percent.<p>Maytag brews the three newest, in tiny quantities, for several reasons, all of which come down to his love of beer. He says, "The Christmas ale is a brewer''s midwinter custom. It''s also a present to the people who support us, and it''s a way of reconnecting with the roots of a Christmas tradition. This year all the barley in our Christmas beer comes from one farm near Tule Lake, California. Our employees went up there for the harvest to see the source of what we make and to see our connections with nature - the risks in nature. As for barley wine, I make it because I believe in it. I came to love it when I studied brewing in England. Our Old Foghorn requires twice as much grain for half as much brew as an ordinary beer, it''s a nuisance to bottle, and it''s expensive to make. But barley wine is one of the most interesting drinks on earth, although it''s poorly understood and not much appreciated. It''s something to sip by the hearth. A contemplative drink. It''ll never have wide popularity, but I own the place and I can do what I like. A brewery should have a hallmark - a drink of absolute distinction. Old Foghorn will become ours. Wheat beer? I''ve said for years that it could have a big audience, and ours will. In a way, it''s the  opposite of Old Foghorn - it''s a hot-day, light drink. It''s our lawn-mower beer. "<p>Today only 10 percent of production is draft beer, all steam, and available only locally. But Anchor and Liberty are crossing the country in bottles. Last fall they even reached my town, in the middle of Missouri. Maytag says, "If micro means production under ten thousand barrels a year, then we were a micro for a decade. We''ve grown because what we make is true, traditional, honest, and good. We celebrate the materials for what they are." By that he means at least 80 percent of the mash is two-row barley in all of the brews, because, he believes, the cheaper, six-row variety used by the industrials gives a coarser beer. Maytag adds whole hop flowers - no hop pellets - at three different times and is willing to dump any batch that goes a bit awry. For the Liberty he uses a dry hopping that gives superb aroma and splendid taste. Nowhere an additive or adjunct. Anchor observes the Reinheitsgebot.<p>Maytag''s change to quality brought recognition, and the move to bottling brought a following. Today Anchor is the fastest-growing old-name brewery in the country, but, Maytag told us when The Venerable and I toured the brewhouse, the growth will stop at 50,000 barrels. "I won''t swear I''ll stop there, but one should have guidelines, a controlling principle. I like a business that''s small enough for the employees to see our interdependency."<p> Mark Carpenter, Anchor''s production manager, his white overalls turned to camouflage by yeast stains and penciled brewing times, said, "One of my fears is that Anheuser-Busch will start making a real ale. I''m afraid our growth will catch their eye. Maybe keeping our customers was easier when people laughed at something called steam beer." The anxiety is whimsical.  Makers of traditional brews know that the market for wet-air beers will remain large.<p>When we came out of the Anchor brewhouse and headed toward the tasting room, Joseph Owades stepped around the corner. Incredibly, here he stood - the father of Wet Air, the arch-Satan, Old Scratch incarnate. The Venerable alleges that once my surprise passed, I began tapping about my belt, as if feeling for a sidearm. Within reach stood the man who did in American beer. I asked why he did it.<p>Owades - suited and vested without flaw, a trim man with a clipped moustache - was there because he had just finished teaching his seminar "All About Beer" there. The biochemist was the first Ph.D. in the American brewing industry, writing his dissertation on cholesterol; he went to work for  Fleischmann''s Yeast, where he became interested in the microbial action of yeasts. Later he joined the Rheingold Brewery, in New York City, and became fascinated with taking out "calories that beer doesn''t need." He believed that people resisted drinking beer for two reasons, taste and fear of weight gain, So, after much research, he wrote a recipe that reduced calories and "lightened" even further the mild taste of lager. Owades told me, "Lowering carbohydrates - calories - also lowers the mouth feel. The analogy''s not  exact, but a regular beer stays on the tongue like ice cream; a light slides off like a sherbet. That changes taste."<p>Rheingold produced the first light recipe, under the name of Gablinger. Soon the secret to a low-calorie beer - the enzyme amyloglucosidase - was out. After Philip Morris Companies took over Miller Brewing, the corporation bought the rights to the name Lite from the MeisterBrau Brewing Company and let go with the advertising. American beer drinking hasn''t been the same since. "What can you expect," The Venerable said, "when a tobacco company gets into brewing?"<p>I asked Owades what beer he drinks. "Since I live in San Francisco now, I usually drink Anchor Steam." I asked if his research had made him wealthy. "I got my usual monthly salary."<p>Not to atone for light beer but because he was hired, Owades wrote the generally respected recipe for the East Coast brew New Amsterdam Amber.<p>"Tell me," The Venerable asked, "can you tell the difference between, say, a Budweiser and a Coors?"<p>"All major American beers are structurally very similar. No, after two beers I won''t be able to tell the difference between a Budweiser and a Coors, but with an Anchor Steam and a Redhook, I could distinguish them after a half dozen. It''s true that micro-brewers are broadening the spectrum, but you''ll see a lot of them fail, because brewing''s hard work, and what they produce just isn''t good. But for the best ones, a metropolitan area will support them."<p>MICRO-BREWERY FAILURES SO FAR HAVE COME MORE FROM undercapitalization than from poor brew. The New Albion Brewing Company, of Sonoma, California, the first true American micro, went under because it began bottling before it was financially able to produce beer in quantity. In distribution Jonah must face the leviathan. An industrial brewer can make distribution very difficult for a small brewer (sometimes by illegal means). One solution: eliminate distribution altogether by running beer from the maturation tank to the customer''s glass, or, as The Venerable said, "Put the cat under the milk cow." In this country brew pubs are still scarce, but in colonial America a traveler could find tavern after tavern serving its own beer.<p>The brew pub also provides the owner with complete control over his ales and lagers, an important consideration when excellence is the aim. No other alcoholic beverage is so sensitive, so perishable, as beer. It will change from towel lint in the glass, from a refrigerator five degrees off, from sitting in a glass on a waiter''s tray an extra two minutes, on and on.  Virtually everything that is not beer is its enemy.<p>In Hayward, California, on the lower east side of San Francisco Bay, The Venerable and I went to Buffalo Bill''s Brewpub, where Bill Owens, the owner, said, "The wave is the brew pub, and I''m on the crest." His influential book of photographs titled Suburbia brought him a Guggenheim fellowship in 1976.<p>Then he published Our Kind of People and, later, Working: Or I Do It for the Money. The books earned him little more than respect. Owens said, "Photojournalism had peaked. I got in on the dying days, the back end. Now I''m in on the front end of something. Now I can write checks faster than they bounce. In ten years there''ll be a hundred brew pubs in the United States, and you''ll see me in Fortune. Instead of shooting assignments on colored popcorn for them, 1''11 be the subject. That''s the difference between back ends and front ends."<p>Owens began brewing a few gallons at home in the early seventies. At his fortieth-birthday party, in 1978, a friend said, "Let''s open a brewery." They looked at a couple of micros and decided that a bottling line was too expensive and too complex, and so they abandoned the idea. (They do, however, bottle for takeout.) Then, the next year, they heard about brew pubs, revolting against the Americanization of British beer-making, that were opening all across Britain. In 1983, when the brew pub became legal in California, Owens set up a limited partnership, sold twenty-seven shares, and raised $110,000. "A good idea sells much easier and for more money than a good photograph." He rented an old downtown building, once a camera store, gutted it, and built a tiny brewhouse in the back with a picture window to allow the customer to sit, sip, and see his brew made. He tore up the floor and laid sixty-two feet of pipe from the brewroom to the bar with the help of an investor who works on nuclear bombs. That sixty-two feet is his distribution system; it, as much as anything else, allows him to compete with the industrials. By scrounging equipment from a candy company, a food  manufacturer, and a dairy, he assembled his brewing apparatus for $35,000.  On September 9, 1983, he opened the third brew pub in the United States. The first batch of Buffalo Bill he made went on sale, and today he''s unsure whether he''s ever dumped anything even if he should have. A customer told me, "That early stuff was out of the buffalo''s posterior. It had hoofs and horns in it. Now he''s about perfected it. I''m a fixture here, part of the pipeline."<p>Owens brews six barrels every Monday, about three hundred barrels a year. "For a hundred and thirty dollars'' worth of ingredients I can make a twenty-five-hundred-dollar profit. A glass of lager - that''s all I brew now - costs seven cents. I sell it for a dollar and a half. Compare my profit on a bottle of commercial beer - forty cents." Last year half of his $200,000 gross income came from Buffalo Bill Beer, the rest from sandwiches and other beers. <p>He wrote a book titled How to Build a Small Brewery, which he sells over the bar and by mail, and he bought up two home-brewing magazines and consolidated them into a quarterly, American Brewer. Owens told The  Venerable and me, "It doesn''t bring in money so much as it puts me on the map as a pioneer. It keeps me in touch with people in the industry."<p> With plans to open two more places in 1988, he''s trademarked the term Brewpub in California. He wants a half dozen pubs, some in malls, with the brewhouse in the front window to lure in strollers. He wants to franchise.<p>"My fun is promoting. If the television camera is here, I get out my big paddle and stir the mash. It''s not necessary to stir. It''s just graphic. Look, everybody wants to be an entrepreneur now. I''m on the edge of the revolution - the making-money-and-enjoying-it revolution. A lot of micro-brewers are purists. Ale is the Holy Grail. I''m not interested in that. You find chemists and chefs - I''m a chef. I know my truth is best. I do it the easy way. I boil for an hour because my timer runs for an hour. I use pellet hops, but I don''t use malt extracts and I don''t filter. My water is snowmelt from the mountains, just like Anchor''s. But I don''t care if Americans don''t know what ale is. I don''t care if they''re afraid of it. I know that light rum outsells dark rum three to one, and I know that Americans want their beer cold, clarified, and carbonated. I don''t make an  ale, and I can''t waste my time educating Americans about ale. It''s not my job. I''m interested in making my own kind of beer. This isn''t Burger King. You can''t have it your way. You get it my way. I work by one rule: Don''t get complicated. Don''t build a Rolls-Royce factory to make a go-cart. There''s one other rule: Take the profit off the top."<p>The Venerable, always ready to play advocate for the devil, asked, "Would you say that you emphasize the style of dispensing over the product?" "The style brings a customer in, but it''s the beer that has to bring him back."<p> South of Sacramento, near Interstate 5, we stopped in a bar overhung with ferns, stained glass, old-time signs. We went in looking not for the perfect bar but only for a working phone. We knew that men who discuss the bubbles in a head of beer, who read patterns in the Irish lace - those men do not come into bars like this. Yet we had a small hope that some bottle of an untried oddity might be tucked away. The offerings, of course, were Hobson''s choice. Maybe the wish to put a touchstone to these last days of golden glasses urged us, I don''t know, but we ordered our Hobson''s, our industrial.  The Venerable lifted his glass, drank, and set it down. He turned to me blankly and said, "Did I miss my mouth?"<p><blockquote class="smalltext"><i><br>via <a href="http://www.wesjones.com/moon1.htm">http://www.wesjones.com/moon1.htm</a><p><p>

<i>Boom, bust or booze up?</i><p>


By Craig Pinhey <p>

Last weekend (Sept. 11-12) the first East Coast Festival of Beer took place at the Garrison Grounds by the Citadel in Halifax, Nova Scotia. Organized by the Cottage Creek Corporation (who also do the Toronto and Kingston Fests), this was the first attempt to celebrate and capitalize on the exciting beer scene that has developed in Nova Scotia in the past few years. <p>

The conclusions reached on the fate of this fest are not known yet - I personally hope it becomes a mainstay in the beer scene, but the success was not immediately evident, maybe due to the rainy Saturday or other events going on in Metro. More on this later, but first let''s talk about the beer! <p>

The Halifax microbreweries were well represented, with Garrison sporting a nice booth serving their red ale, pale ale, raspberry wheat and brown, all good beers. Unfortunately I don''t think the jalopeno or Khybeer (coffee) beer were available. They were also sporting new hire Dave Slichter, known in Ontario for brewing at the Hart, F&M and Trafalgar microbreweries at various times. Propeller Brewery had a nifty set-up, which had their staple products, a hoppy Pale Ale, a maltier Bitter, and the German influenced Tattoo. The Propeller booth shared space with Sharp Angus Hemp Ale, a contract brew they do for a local hemp store owner. <p>

Sharp Angus has a great label, the rather Amish looking Angus being an homage to the original Captain of the Bluenose. The beer uses hemp seeds, and apparently there were some Governmental controls exercised on the processing of the hemp ingredient, which we won''t get into here. As far as taste goes, the beer is very subtle. <p>

Maritime Brewing Company, a Regional Brewery in Dartmouth, had a big contingent led by Kirk Annand, the head brewer (ex of Moosehead). Their beers are in between micro and major style, with Black Pearl Cream Ale being the most flavourful. They were busy tattooing people with Frosted Frog logos, a big hit with the 19 and over kids in the crowd. Tattoos were a theme of the day, as many of the beer drinkers were seeking them out ambitiously - one gentleman in particular was branded on his face with Molson, Frog and Alpine logos (and Alpine wasn''t even available at the fest). <p>

Nova Scotia''s newest micro, the New Scotland Brewery from Pictou County, was present with their Caber Ale (a somewhat hoppy Scottish Ale) and their Golden Rye Ale (an all grain blond ale not too far removed from a typical Canadian Ale). It was great to see them purveying their wares. Come to think of it, I meant to purchase one of their cool ball caps with their distinctly Nova Scotian emblem. <p>

Brewpubs were not able to bring draught here, which points to Nova Scotia''s particularly prohibitionist (aka dumb) beer legislation. Therefore, the only way that the Granite Brewery (one of Canada''s original brewpubs and certainly a mecca for all North American beer enthusiasts) could participate was to have Hart Brewery (who contract brew their Peculiar Ale in Ontario and ship it to Nova Scotia!), buy a booth and serve it from the bottle. Granite''s Kevin Keefe shared pouring duties with Hart''s Lorne Hart, and Kevin had lots to say about the Nova Scotia Liquor Commission, which would make for a great future article! This ''law'' meant that the excellent John Shippey''s, Rogues Roost, and Queen Molly (Yarmouth) brewpubs were not present - this is ridiculous! Rogues brewer Lorne Romano was present however, and was seen roaming from booth to booth doing ''research'', perhaps for future Rogue beers? <p>

Pioneering microbrewery Picaroons of Fredericton, New Brunswick was present in the form of co-owner Sean Dunbar, but due to legal restrictions (NSLC again) on bringing their draught, were sharing a booth with beer importers. Their Bitter is a classic in the Maritime beer scene. <p>

Saint John, New Brunswick''s Moosehead was there with their Moosehead Dry and Clancy''s Amber, but sadly had not yet released their hoppy Clancy''s Harvest Ale. Labatt and Molson had big booths with lots of action surrounding them (due to mini-golf or perhaps girls in tight shirts and short skirts). Labatt''s (Interbrew) also had their Oland''s Specialty Brands set-up serving Belgian beers in the proper manner (wasting quite a bit of beer). They were serving Belle Vue Kriek (sour-cherry pop beer), Hogaarden Wit (yum!) and Leffe Blond (Yum Yum!), and a few others of less interest. There were other imported beers around, but my interest was generally in local produce. Interbrew''s locally produced Keith''s IPA (actually tastes like a typical Canadian ale) was there as well. Keith''s has most of the Nova Scotian market, but this was not reflected in their booth which was rather low key. <p>

Food was available, both in the form of a few local restaurants who had booths and also the ubiquitous Planters Peanuts, represented by a large Peanut head walking around all day giving out nuts (that job rates up there in the suckiest of all time). They must have given lots of sponsorship money, because, on walking in, one would have thought this was a freaking peanut festival. What IS nutty is that the Kentville based Paddy''s Brewpub had a food booth, but (this is getting repetitive) could not bring their brewpub crafted beer! I noted that the Oyster shucker booth was very popular - but they should have had draught stout right next to it so people could try this classic combo. <p>

I was lucky to scam my way into the VIP tent, where the Economy Shoe Shop (aka the culture dome) Restaurant had set up a food area for the so-called VIP''s. The Shoe Shop is one of the hottest bars in Halifax, has a great eclectic food selection, a singing Chef, and serves beer from the local breweries. At times it seemed there were more VIP''s than patrons at the fest... <p>

Cottage Creek did have a speakers lounge set up on the grounds, where noted beer historian (and funnyman) Ian Bowering and Kingston Brewing Company Real Ale Guru Roger Eccleston gave talks. To be honest, this festival was not set up right for this, as there was live music playing all day (pretty good music by the way). Ian and Roger must have found this difficult, which is sad because they are both engaging and entertaining speakers. I think an enclosed tent and better advertising of speakers is in order for next year, not to mention hiring a local beer expert (like myself or my brother Jeff, hint hint) rather than only bringing in Upper Canadians (as much as I like them). <p>

So, was this fest a boom or a bust? I don''t know - yet. Rumours were that they were counting on over 4000 people over Saturday and Sunday. Based on unofficial rumours, there were less than 1000 on Saturday, and under 2000 combined for both days. <p>

This does not bode well for profit, but I don''t expect they profited in the first year of the Toronto Beer Fest either. I am not privy to whatever sponsorship money they received, which can tilt the scales pretty heavily. Certainly the timing could have been better, as the Fest coincided with the Air Show (which drew over 100,000 people with strange priorites) and the 2 pm Sunday home opener of the popular Halifax Mooseheads Junior A hockey team. <p>

One thing that bothered me was the price. $20 in advance ($25 at the door) got you in, and gave you 10 tickets for 2 oz samples. That is pricey for Maritimers, especially for an outdoor fest where rain is a concern. I think a lower entry price would improve attendance, as well as better advertising indicating that there was plenty of room under the tents for rain protection (I didn''t even get a bit wet). They might find that they make more money on ticket sales than in Toronto, as I think we Maritimers would stay longer and drink more (no offense intended - none taken!). <p>

I would also take a look at the live bands - does it pay back in ticket sales? I doubt it. People will not always pay extra for music, especially since doors closed at 8 pm - anyone interested in paying for live music generally doesn''t expect it until after 10 pm. Maybe a few selected buskers would be more economical. Or, shift the hours to open later and close at normal bar closing time, to make it more like a bar. <p>

Regardless of my criticisms, I hope they do it again next year, and I will be there. I had a great time. I met many fellow beer enthusiasts and had a chance to talk to brewers, not to mention running into old friends from High School. The beer was great - the weather inconsequential to my enjoyment. If it wasn''t for my being under the weather in a different sense, this would have been a great booze-up! Perhaps next year the archaic laws will be struck down and all Maritime brewers, micros, brewpubs, macros, homebrewers etc. will be welcome to participate. Yeah, right! <p>

<h4>Wiesel: The fanatics are back</h4>

Brock Harrison<br>
Local News - Thursday, November 23, 2006 Updated @ 12:18:31 AM<p>

With well over a thousand people hanging on his every word, Elie Wiesel, a man rescued from a Nazi concentration camp, said suffering is not inflicted by tyrants, murderers or dictators. "But by those who stood by and watched it happen," Wiesel said, reprising the central theme of not only his day at Queen&#8217;s University but of his life&#8217;s work.  "Indifference is what society is taught, but humanity must fight indifference to be what it is."<p>Wiesel, a Nobel Peace Prize winner, author, journalist, human rights activist and Holocaust survivor, packed the Stauffer Library on the Queen&#8217;s campus last night.  Taking aim at indifference, the Jewish Wiesel impressed on the students, teachers and other dignitaries in attendance, that nothing threatens humanity more than apathy and neutrality toward the suffering of mankind.  "I can&#8217;t be witness to humiliation and not protest. I can&#8217;t suffer for another person, but I can be present for another&#8217;s suffering," he said.<p>Students hung over railings, lined stairwells and hunkered together in rooms with television feeds to hear the words of a man who has addressed presidents and prime ministers and the United Nations Security Council.  He told them that apathy and indifference grip even the highest echelons of power.  He said former United States president Jimmy Carter once showed him aerial photographs of Auschwitz, the most well-known Nazi concentration camp during the Holocaust, taken by accident by American fighter jets.  "&#8216;Who had seen them?&#8217; I asked. &#8216;The Pentagon and the White House?&#8217; " Wiesel recounted. "They knew it was there."<p>He spoke of being naive, thinking the 21st century would be an improvement on the 20th, and that a new age of peace and compassion would emerge. He said an indifference toward human destiny has given rise to a new, but historic, type of fanaticism &#8211; religious.  "The fanatics are back," Wiesel said. "And a new weapon has been granted. Suicide terrorists."  Wiesel urged students to circulate petitions to the prime minister, U.S. president and the UN secretary general calling for an end to the humanitarian crisis in Darfur and actions to stop Iran from becoming a nuclear nation.  <p>He condemned Iranian president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad for his repeated threats against Israel&#8217;s existence.  "He hasn&#8217;t been ostracized and he hasn&#8217;t been excommunicated. He should be considered persona non-grata," Wiesel said.  Wiesel also assured the crowd that he&#8217;d feel as much outrage toward Ahmadinejad no matter which country he threatened.<p>Earlier in the day, Wiesel met with a group of 75 students in a fireside room in Stauffer and took questions from them for about an hour.  Again on indifference, he warned the students to guard against the apathy that mires today&#8217;s society.  "I cannot stand that word, relax," he said. "I don&#8217;t want to relax. If you relax too much, it&#8217;s not only a sin. It is a curse."  Many of the students had read Wiesel&#8217;s best-known book, Night, a memoir of his experience in Nazi concentration camps, and asked questions about it.  Wiesel said he had written it for Holocaust survivors who were too emotionally scared to speak up about the atrocities that went on to their own children.  "I became a surrogate father to many," he said.<p>Afterward, Judy Csillag told Wiesel that, as the daughter of Holocaust survivors who didn&#8217;t share their ordeals, he had become her surrogate father. "My parents never spoke about it. I picked up his book and I was able to see what they went through and it put it into perspective for me," said Csillag, who works for the Centre for Diversity Education and Training in Toronto.  Wiesel also told the students not to worry about Holocaust deniers, saying he doesn&#8217;t have the time or the sympathy to invest time in trying to make them believe.  "They ultimately will be shamed into silence," he said.<p>Wiesel&#8217;s thoughtful approach to his message left a lasting impression on Queen&#8217;s student Julie Herczeg.  "I was so unbelievably moved and touched by how well thought out and how true his intentions are," she said. "He was so down to earth. That&#8217;s what moved me the most."  RMC student Pierre-Luc Rivard said Wiesel&#8217;s campaign against indifference is powerful.  "It was very deep," he said. "It&#8217;s hard to be indifferent when you listen to him and read his books."  When asked how students can begin to defeat the indifference Wiesel has waged war against, he advised them to always be aware of the moral component to every subject they study.

Whatever it is you can click on each picture for a bigger image.<p>In the early fall - actually on <a href="http://www.bartowel.com/board/viewtopic.php?t=2587&postdays=0&postorder=asc&start=60">September 28th 2006</a> just after noon - I jumped into my first LCBO private order, two cases from Hair of the Dog brewery in Portland Oregon being organized by the <a href="http://www.bartowel.com/">Bar Towellers</a> out of Toronto.   I faxed through my deposit of $51.60 CND on a total order of $197.96 CND.  I ordered one each of Doggie Claws and Fred, two 10% or so barley wines from one of North America''s top boutique brewers.  And then I waited.  And waited.<p>Around the first of December, the order came into Toronto, I paid the balance and waited for it to make its way 220 km or so east to Kingston.  <a href="http://www.genx40.com/images/2006h/dog1.JPG"><img src="http://www.genx40.com/images/2006h/dog1a.JPG" align="left" vspace="10" hspace="20"></a>Then there were rumours of <a href="http://www.bartowel.com/board/viewtopic.php?t=2800&start=15">issues with the capping</a>.  Excellent, I thought - bottle variation.  The curse of decent wine.  Jon Walker, a Bar Toweller, noted:<blockquote class="smalltext">This thread worries me. As a result I went in to check on my stash of HOTD and indeed many of the caps are not fully crimped onto the bottles. Most flair at their base and do not fully grip the lip of the bottle. I was actually able to press up on one with my thumb and get the gas to release in the "PPST" common to uncapping. What do I do know? I don''t have a capper to close the caps properly (if they actually CAN be sealed, perhaps they are the wrong size???). I''ve got just shy of 70 bottles left and I''m loathe to believe I might lose some to oxidation due to loose caps.</blockquote><p>The cases showed today, 21 December 2006, about 12 weeks after they were ordered which is really not that bad seeing as I think the beer was still in the tanks when the order was originally placed.  But there was an obvious problem from one look at the case of Fred that seemed to echo Jon''s words above.<p><center><a href="http://www.genx40.com/images/2006h/dog2.JPG"><img src="http://www.genx40.com/images/2006h/dog2a.JPG" hspace="30" vspace="15"></a><a href="http://www.genx40.com/images/2006h/dog3.JPG"><img src="http://www.genx40.com/images/2006h/dog3a.JPG" hspace="30" vspace="15"></a></center><p>When I got home I decided to have a look inside and what I found was not pretty.  The inside of the box was soaked.  Ten bottles were seriously uncapped with significant beer loss with mostly empty necks like above at the right.  In addition, twelve were showing little beer loss and two showed some promise.  All were irregularly capped in the same way.  Some caps show some rubbing and wear like there was a mechanical issue when they were put on.<p><center><a href="http://www.genx40.com/images/2006h/dog4.JPG"><img src="http://www.genx40.com/images/2006h/dog4a.JPG" vspace="10"></a></center><p>It looked as though it was shipped upside down as there is plenty of yeast in the necks and a fair amount of beery sneakery out from underneath the caps.  No violence to the box, just seeping.  This may actually be a short term saving grace.  The smell is also rich and clean, not sour like a bar on Sunday morning.  I will have to have one.  I am a little depressed, a little pissed off and a little curious.  I have not even looked at the box of Doggie Claws.<p><center><a href="http://www.genx40.com/images/2006h/dog7.JPG"><img src="http://www.genx40.com/images/2006h/dog7a.JPG" hspace="30" vspace="15"></a><a href="http://www.genx40.com/images/2006h/dog8.JPG"><img src="http://www.genx40.com/images/2006h/dog8a.JPG" hspace="30" vspace="15"></a></center><p>Much to my surprise, the beer, picked from the worst group of ten, opens with a loud <i>Pfffft!!</i>  The yeast had created a seal inside as you can see below to the right and it pours with a huge head.  It is huge and lovely and lively.  Hallelujah!  Christmas is saved.  Christmas is saved.  And the Doggie Claws show no sign of leakage at all with the same location of the irregular capping as the Fred but with a lot less severity.
<p>So it will likely be a crap shoot one a bottle by bottle basis but if that yeast cakes up it may last throughout the holidays at least.  "Pour slowly to allow sediment to remain in the bottle" it says on the back.  What can you do?  That yeast is my best friend right about now.<p><center><a href="http://www.genx40.com/images/2006h/dog5.JPG"><img src="http://www.genx40.com/images/2006h/dog5a.JPG" vspace="10"></a></center><p>', '2006-12-22 05:54:12', '2008-06-12 14:46:58.476125', 0, true, false, true, 'acoupleof', false);

Seeing as you have so little to do during these days of the great silence, perhaps you could contact that chum of yours in the office of the Finance Critic to find out why the hell nothing has been said yet about this article in the Globe yesterday. Notice this sort of wording:<blockquote class-"smalltext">Federal Finance Minister Jim Flaherty signalled Monday he will not eliminate the capital gains tax in his first budget. The Conservative government had campaigned on eliminating the tax for individuals on the sale of assets when proceeds are reinvested within six months. But Mr. Flaherty told reporters the government is still considering some election commitments, including when to eliminate the capital gains tax. He wouldn''t elaborate on which other promises are under consideration.</blockquote>One wonders whether this sort of back stroking by the government before they have stood before Parliament for a single day is a little more important than the sorts of considerations I am hearing about on booking the proper hotel room in Montreal in December and who''s best placed to come second to Mr. Smarty Pants.

Barley, wheat and neutral hops go into the quiet, musty Brussels brewery; beer as tart and complex as any wine comes out. Its sour taste is so unusual that brewer Jean Van Roy says, "We get many visitors each year who like wine and not beer."<p>

Many casual beer lovers equate lambics with fruit beers, but the term refers to a Belgian beer made with wild yeast. Most breweries use commercial yeast, preferring lab-grown safety to natural chance; by royal decree, lambic brewers must exploit airborne yeast somewhere in the beer-making process. But the prestige of the term "lambic" and its vague definition tempt producers to take liberties.<p>

Van Roy doesn''t need loopholes for his label: Tradition and passion have guided the brewery since his father Jean-Pierre took over, abolishing the standard practice of adding saccharine to the brew and forgoing an industrial route.<p>

"If Jean-Pierre hadn''t made that decision," says Cantillon''s importer Dan Shelton, "nobody would be talking and fighting about traditional lambic today, and no one would be claiming to make it." Cantillon now makes only dry beer with organic ingredients. Most breweries seek out shortcuts; Cantillon follows the difficult road.<p>

After Van Roy mixes water with the grain -- 65 percent barley and 35 percent wheat -- and heats the mixture to extract starches and sugars, he pumps the liquid, or wort, into a shallow, 300-square-foot all-copper basin in the brewery''s attic. He then opens the shutters and cools the mix overnight before he moves the lambic to oak casks. Wild yeasts settle on the wort, both from outside and from the thriving population in the building. When the brewery replaced the roof, the family kept the old tiles and wedged them above the rafters to preserve their house yeast. Even with in-house reserves, each batch can vary wildly from one night to the next.<p>

"Before Pasteur," says Van Roy, "every beer was made this way." Yeast exists everywhere, but any fan of San Francisco sourdough knows that not all populations are equal. Bay Area yeast makes superb bread; Brussels yeast makes superb beer. The 80 to 120 strains of yeast in any cask of lambic create a universe of complex flavors: earthiness, cheese, foie gras and more.<p>

Few breweries have the patience to let beer sit for at least a year before it sees a bottle, but Cantillon is a sea of oak barrels filled with aging lambic. Like it does in a wine cellar, the porous wood matures the beer and smoothes its harsh edges. Spiderwebs sit in the corners of the white walls like a decorator''s tasteful flair, a natural way to keep away hungry flies.<p>

But 1-year-old lambic is still young, and won''t go solo into a bottle. Van Roy blends this still-fermenting liquid with more complex 2- and 3-year-old lambic to produce the style of lambic called gueuze.<p>

A second fermentation starts in the bottle as the older, dormant yeast meet the sugar in the young beer, giving the mix a fluffy head when poured. "We call it Brussels Champagne," says Van Roy. Every batch of Cantillon lambic is different, but as with the famous sparkler, blending gives gueuze a consistent flavor profile.<p>

Van Roy also adds fruit to the young beer to create fruit lambics, an old way to stretch beer and harvest alike. You''ll find industrial versions of this genre in good markets, but the average kriek (cherry) or framboise (raspberry) has nothing in common with Cantillon''s version. Industrial brewers flavor -- and sweeten -- their drinks with fruit syrups. "Kids get this syrup in their yogurt," says Van Roy, "so of course they like it when they find it later in their beer." Cantillon prefers whole fruit, letting it macerate until the piranha-like microbes have devoured all the pulp and all the sugar. Only cherry pits survive the yeasty feast.<p>

In the past, brewers bought fruit from local farmers, but the city of Brussels has spread since Cantillon opened its doors in 1900. Van Roy now has to look across Europe for good fruit. Only the cherries still come from Belgium.<p>

Lambic''s mouth-puckering tartness makes it hard to drink on its own; drink it with a meal instead. Garrett Oliver, author of "The Brewmaster''s Table," serves gueuze with foods you normally wash down with a crisp, flavorful white wine: mussels, goat cheese and terrines. He pairs Cantillon''s dry fruit lambics, on the other hand, with richer dishes: duck confit, goose or Mexican mole sauce.<p>

Tradition is a tenuous thing, cast aside in favor of methods that ease the labor but hurt the taste. But in a quiet neighborhood of Brussels, Cantillon keeps it alive with each crisp bottle of beer.<p>

Tasting notes<p>

Cantillon beers, which are sold in full-size wine bottles, can be hard to find, but PlumpJack Wines in Noe Valley usually has some in stock, and Ledger''s Liquors in Berkeley can order it for you. Most of the bottles are also available from John''s Grocery (www.johnsgrocery.com), which can ship to California. Just make sure you''ve got a few bottle openers handy: The brewery protects its beer with both a crown cap and a cork.<p>

NV Cantillon Gueuze ($16) This flagship drink''s foamy head isn''t large for the beer world, but it towers over the light wash of bubbles in Cantillon''s other bottles. The beer''s subtle aroma suggests Parmigiano cheese, but the flavor suggests lemonade and apple cider with a dash of grapefruit juice. A floral finish rounds out this sour brew.<p>

NV Cantillon Iris ($19) Van Roy makes this beer the same way as the rest of his lambics, but he doesn''t put the term on the label because he uses 100 percent barley in the mix, not the barley and wheat combination of traditional lambic. This relatively mellow beer might be a nice stepping-stone for the Cantillon newbie, with aromas of apples and grapefruit that sit atop a pleasant earthiness. The tame acidity lifts a delicate lemon zest flavor. A hint of vanilla reveals itself on the long finish.<p>

NV Cantillon RosÃ© de Gambrinus ($17) Cantillon''s framboise has the color of a cranberry spritzer but the complex aromas and flavor of a great wine. A rich, dusty smell of horses and earth wafts up from the glass. The tart beer has flavors of foie gras and cheese, with a citrus-pith bitterness. The raspberries are surprisingly subtle until the finish, when a last whip crack of fruit hits the palate.<p>

NV Cantillon Vigneronne ($17) Van Roy connects beer and wine directly in this fruit lambic made with Muscat grapes. The beer features grapefruit and light floral aromas, but the grapes create wax and soap flavors that overwhelm the subtle tastes in the beer.', '2007-04-15 19:43:36', '2008-06-12 14:46:58.592966', 0, true, true, true, 'cantillonabrew', true);

Published April 4, 2007', 'Last month we were on the phone with George Randall talking booze, and there was a tinge of relief in his voice. He''d invested nearly $100,000 transforming an old warehouse into a retail destination at the corner of Jefferson Avenue and Interstate 44, and the city had been jerking him around. Imagine that! All he wanted to do was open a jumbo wine-and-spirits store in St. Louis city, and The Man seemed to be having none of it. Ever since downtown''s 905 Liquors shuttered sometime in the 1980s, we St. Louisans have had to settle for Schnucks â or have had to hoof it to the county â when we wanted to get drunk on decent drink. And some downtown asshole was standing in our way.<p>

Ultimately, the civil servants backed off, and the most solid evidence yet of St. Louis'' revival sits on the west end of the beautiful McKinley Heights neighborhood. For the past few weeks, Randall''s Wine and Spirits has been in soft-opening mode, quietly unveiling its shop to the wide-eyed few who have ambled in. The store celebrated its grand opening this past Sunday.<p>

Drink of the Week is an unapologetic cheerleader for things we consider great, and Randall''s Wine and Spirits is â how to put it? â fricking awesome. Walk in and all you see are shelves and bottles â 12,000 square feet of them, in fact. It''s like you''ve snuck into a booze wholesaler and someone will soon shoo you away. On that first glimpse, you see the forest. Start browsing, however, and the trees reveal themselves. Rows and rows of every spirit imaginable. Huge islands of wines from all over the world. Thirty-two feet of beer â two shelves of British ales, and twice that many American microbeers. Germany, Austria, Japan â hell, even Canada is represented. Curious about Belgian lambic beers? Yes. They''ve got a dozen different varieties.<p>

We don''t even know if we like true-blue lambics, so on our second visit we grabbed a few based on New York Times wine/spirit/beer expert Eric Asimov''s recommendation. He featured them in a column last year, and we''ve been intrigued ever since. Wrote Asimov: "It''s perhaps the most unusual beer around, truly made in the old-fashioned way. It is not at all easy to find. You will most likely have to seek out a shop specializing in great beers of the world, but I assure you it is worth the effort."<p>

Bingo â Randall''s carries a handful of them, including Asimov''s favorite, Cantillon Classic Gueuze, as well as four varieties of the more ubiquitous (and arguably less authentic) Lindemans, including framboise (raspberry) and kriek (black cherry). Feeling adventurous, we grabbed the Cantillon Classic and the Cantillon Gran Cru; as a backup we also bought the two Lindemans.<p>

What did we learn? That traditional lambic is a very odd creation, sour and dry â almost cidery â and has more the character of an oddball Champagne than a beer. It takes a long time to get used to, and it''s much easier if, before you take your first sip, you absolutely remove any thought that what you are about to drink is "beer." This owes in large part to the method of making lambic, a process called spontaneous fermentation. Whereas most ales and lagers are infused with specific, handpicked yeasts, lambics invite Mother Nature in, and use as their yeast whichever is floating around the Senne valley of Belgium. Once the fermentation begins, the beer is poured into barrels and aged.<p>

Cantillon Classic Gueuze is less shocking than the Gran Cru, mainly because the former is carbonated, and the latter is flat. ("Gueuze" refers to a blended lambic; a pure lambic contains only one vintage.) Both share that shocking sourness, and for that reason we''re not sure if we''ll be drinking much lambic in the future.<p>

At the risk of sounding like beer-chugging Missourians, we couldn''t appreciate the tasting notes that Asimov describes â "pure, tart, almost smoky dry flavors" â because we were overwhelmed by the oddity. With time and patience, we''re sure we''d get used to it (or learn how to fake it). But the mere fact that all of a sudden, a few blocks from our house, there''s a place that sells something we''ve never tried before (and so much more) is worthy of celebration.<p>

Sambuca, ouzo, a wide array of Italian grappas, French eaux-de-vie (many). Randall''s sells bottom-shelf rot-gut bourbon and very pricey bottles â including one we''ve been itching to taste since we first read about it: Charbay Double Barrel Release One Whiskey. (It''s $339.) Cheap single-malt Scotches sit next to a $450 Highland Park 25-year-old. Mescals and tequilas, top-shelf rums, vodkas and gins.<p>

We''ve been to Randall''s three times now and haven''t even started diving into their wine selection. But the owner''s philosophy bides well. "I don''t need to show off," George Randall says. "If you want to be a wine seller that sells $200, $500 bottles of wine, that''s cool, but that is such a small part of what I think the wine and liquor business is about."<p>

Randall, whose flagship location is in Fairview Heights, Illinois, calls the new location "a heck of a wine shop â like Sam''s or Costco as far as pricing."<p>

He says he plans to stock "a couple hundred thousand dollars''" worth of Bordeaux, and last month he ordered a half-million dollars'' worth of Burgundy. Randall just returned from Europe, where he scoured the wineries of southern France and Spain for good deals As an importer, he''ll sell his wine at prices just above wholesale.<p>

Accompanying multi-media report <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/packages/khtml/2006/05/02/dining/20060503_TASTING_FEATURE.html">here</a>.', 'Many wine lovers tend to think of beer as something monolithic, just as modern art or rap music seem all the same to those who choose not to embrace those subjects. Connoisseurs can rhapsodize for hours over the minute differences between neighboring vineyards in Morey-St.-Denis and Chambolle-Musigny, but beer? Just as long as it''s cold.<p>
To be frank, that''s a position of blindness and should not inspire pride. Would you only eat meat and never try fish? We all know people like that, and we laugh at them. But people who drink only wine and won''t touch beer? They''re considered sophisticated. Excuse me while I chuckle.<p>

Now, I''m not attacking preferences here, only the refusal to consider alternatives. If you have explored beer and decided it''s not for you, well, I toast your open mind. But if you have exiled beers to parts unknown, I have a radical proposal: Take the time to seek out and try a few lambic beers from Belgium and tell me if these are not as complex and distinctive as many fine wines.<p>

What makes this radical? Even many beer drinkers know little about lambic beer. It''s perhaps the most unusual beer around, truly made in the old-fashioned way. It is not at all easy to find. You will most likely have to seek out a shop specializing in great beers of the world, but I assure you it is worth the effort.<p>

Modern breweries today are generally antiseptic environments in which brewers seek absolute control over the chemistry of fermentation. You can imagine them in their lab coats, selecting the proper strains of scientifically prepared yeasts to create the precise flavors and aromas they desire. But lambic beers are made as they were centuries before Pasteur, when the process of fermentation seemed to be a miracle rather than a controlled reaction. Instead of managing fermentation, the lambic brewer leaves it to nature. Wild yeasts, along with just about anything else in the air, shepherd the brew on its path to beerhood, converting barley and wheat sugars into alcohol, producing fascinating and, dare I say, wine-like beers.<p>

The Dining section''s tasting panel recently embarked on a lambic journey. Florence Fabricant and I were joined by two guests, Tony Forder, co-publisher and editor of Ale Street News, a consumer publication, and Jason Bezmen, sommelier and manager of Cafe d''Alsace, an Alsatian restaurant on the Upper East Side that offers an extensive beer list. We tried 25 beers that call themselves lambic, and if that sounds as if I am hedging a little about these beers, it''s because I am.<p>

Traditionally, lambic is a style of wheat beer, made with a combination of malted barley and unmalted wheat. Hops are added not for the sake of bitterness, as they are in many beers, but to act as a preservative. The brew ferments in barrels, like certain examples of that other fermented beverage, and evolves into a dry, almost sour beer with a fresh, lively acidity and an appealing funkiness. As the brew ages, it mellows and takes on a rich, fruity complexity.<p>

You rarely see straight lambics. Generally, young and aged lambics are blended, and the result is called gueuze (pronounced GURZ-uh). Blends in which the young lambic dominates tend to be almost sparkling in their pure, tart, almost smoky dry flavors and are wonderfully refreshing, not unlike a young blanc de blancs Champagne combined with some sauvignon blanc. An older gueuze develops a mild, almost transparent dry fruitiness like what you might find in a fine blanc de noirs Champagne. The mixture of older and younger lambics causes a second fermentation in the bottle, just as in Champagne, which creates its crisp carbonation.<p>

Our No. 2 gueuze, the Lindemans CuvÃ©e RenÃ©, seemed to be very much in the aged gueuze school, with wonderful raspberry aromas that combined with a sort of earthiness. Our No. 1 gueuze, the Cantillon organic, had more of a refreshing, younger lambic element to it, detectable in its citrus edge.<p>

An old tradition in the Senne Valley of Belgium, the center of lambic production, is to steep fruit in the beers, most often cherries to produce kriek, or raspberries to make framboise. The fruit renews the fermentation as the yeast in the brew devours the sugar in the fruit. The result is a beer of stark, penetrating dryness in which the essence of the fruit rings out in a kaleidoscope of bitter, mineral, earthy flavors. <p>

The Cantillon Lou Pepe Kriek, an unusual vintage lambic, was fascinating. Like a good red Burgundy, it seemed to change continually in the glass. The Hanssens Oude Kriek was smooth, with perhaps a little sweetness, yet it too had a welcome complexity, as did the Drie Fonteinen, which had the distinct aroma of sour cherries and minerally, tart nuances. The Boon Framboise was well balanced between funk and fruitiness.<p>

These traditional lambics are made with many other fruits as well. Cantillon even makes one provocatively called Vigneronne, with muscat grapes, which has a wonderful dry, tart fruitiness.<p>

Now here''s the sticky part, and the reason I hedged before in terming all these beers lambic. As in any community of passionate devotees, serious debate rages over what constitutes authentic lambic beer. This debate focuses on the most popular style, which has penetrated the beer market right down to the deli level. I''m speaking of the sweet fruit lambic beers, which often depart from the traditional methods by adding fruit juice or syrup to the brew, resulting in a sweet, sometimes cloying beer.<p>

In making these sweet beers, some brewers are said to use prepared yeasts rather than practicing spontaneous fermentation â the benchmark of a lambic beer. Other questions arise, over which breweries pasteurize and filter their beers, also no-no''s, and which actually blend only a small percentage of lambic into conventionally produced beer, rather than only using lambic beer. The vagueness of the Belgian beer regulations allows brewers to take these shortcuts, says Tim Webb, author of "Good Beer Guide to Belgium" (Gardners Books, 2005).<p>

To raise a glass, say, of the De Troch Apricot Chapeau, a sweet but delicious beer, is to enter a hornets'' nest of tenaciously opinionated beer lovers who question whether these beers qualify as lambic. De Troch, for example, uses fruit juice to flavor its brew. Although Mr. Forder questioned the level of its sweetness, we found it tremendously appealing, with a spicy, nutty fruit flavor.<p>

As much as we liked the apricot beer, both the Van Honsebrouck St. Louis Framboise and De Troch''s Kriek Chapeau had more of a lambic character to them, with a tart core offering a counterpoint to the sweetness of the fruit. And the Cassis from Lindemans, makers of a popular framboise and kriek, which you can sometimes find in corner delis, had a balance to it that we did not find in its other sweet fruit beers.<p>

Is there a place for these sweet brews? Of course. They can be delicious.  Should they be called lambics? I will say only that the sweet brews don''t approach the complexity or character of the dry lambics, although they can certainly be enjoyed for what they are. If you think that sounds like somebody trying to avoid an internecine beer dispute, well, with such powers of perception you are clearly worthy of appreciating the nuances of a fine gueuze.<p>

One final point: It is a lot easier and far more affordable to taste the best beers in the world than the best wines. Beers like the Cantillon Organic Gueuze are the finest examples of their style. Though $12 may sound like a lot for a bottle of beer, even a big one, not when you gauge it against the quality of most $12 bottles of wine. Tradition, terroir (if I may say that about a beer), a historical connection to brewers of the 16th century and a transcendent bottle. Who knew what $12 could buy.<p>

I had missed out on a lot of fun, spent very little time with the best friends I have ever had. So it was time to reward myself. My best friend and I bought tickets to Amsterdam and stuffed our packs with enough threads to last for two weeks.<p>

For the first 5 days we made our home in the red light district, and we quickly learned that our trip coincided with the World Cup. Whereas this event is barely televised and celebrated in the United States, every flatscreen at every bar along the bicycle lined canals in "the Dam" was tuned in for one of the biggest sports events in the world. Sports fans from every country were packed in front of every bar to drink Heineken (definitely not our choice, but when in Rome...) on tap and root for their teams.<p>

On our 6th day there, we went back to the bar on the ground floor of our previous hotel to watch the big England game that everyone had been charging themselves up for on the large projection T.V. that offered no bad views from any corner of the long rectangular pub. We were fortunate to secure the only pool table, and played a few games before we were approached and challenged by a motley pair of Brits that spoke much like Brad Pitt and the pikey gang from the movie Snatch. We understood that a round of drinks was on the line for the game and control of the table, and it took me a few moments to get my less-seasoned partner (who had been getting his ass destroyed until then) to agree to the challenge. Miraculously, we ran the table and agreed to yet another round. They substituted the shorter of their two players for a rather large gentleman, who had just wandered over from the Marijuana Museum across the street, and who had apparently just test drove their medical grade vaporizer to the point of changing ethnic origins. Another game in the bag...and another. We were feeling like champs and our friends were far from dismayed as England was in the lead on screen. After a number of free pints we bought a round out of pure generosity, and our new friends invited us to follow them for a cigarette of Moroccan hashish as we spilled onto the street with the rest of the drunken celebrating patrons.<p>

We walked down an alley that had a number of erotic peep shows for 2 euros, and after a little less coaxing then we might have normally needed, my friend and I found ourselves entering neighboring booths in a circular structure, our UK cohorts to the right of us. I heard coins being deposited and mechanisms being activated and looked for a slot to insert my currency, which had been a donation from the pikeys and a selling point for the excursion, since I was out of pocket change. The trap door in front of me raised up to reveal a one way mirrored window, and a red rotating circular couch upon which a young lady laid in lacy lingerie. She went around a few times before her shoulder straps slid smoothly down her shoulders, and I could hear the time tick away like a wind up toy from the workings of the trap door. We weren''t going to see much for 2 euros, I thought. That''s where I was wrong. We were going to see too much.<p>

From a door on the opposite side of the sex cylinder jumped in a young man in a leopard print banana hammock, who quickly began sniffing and dry humping the woman like a gorilla in heat. The sound of the whining gears of the privacy screen began to slow, and just as our world was about to be thrust back into nudie booth blackness, the veritable Tarzan before us tore off his grape holder to reveal his manhood of behemoth proportions that sported a bend that would make under the sink plumbing and the Colorado River jealous. It looked as if a muppet was crawling out of his ass, and that muppet would have surely been Gonzo.<p>

A moment of silence passed after the booth went dark before laughter simultaneously erupted like a screaming herd of stampeding elephants from the four booths, and we spilled back out onto the street, scarred like schoolboys who had seen an over 60 porno mag, with tears in our eyes from the pure hilarity of the situation. It was definitely a Gonzo afternoon.', '2007-08-12 18:04:35', '2008-06-12 14:46:58.623261', 0, true, true, true, '2007flyingdog', true);

Posted By Sue Yanagisawa Whig-Standard Court Reporter
Posted 2 hours ago

The lawyer for a uranium prospecting company, frustrated by an Algonquin-led protest that disrupted the company''s plans for test drilling north of Sharbot Lake last summer, said it gave him "no pleasure to ask for incarceration."

Yet Neal J. Smitheman asked for exactly that this week, the maximum jail sentence possible in fact, and substantial fines against Algonquin leaders who refused to ''purge'' contempt charges by formally promising not to interfere in the future with his client, Oakville-based Frontenac Ventures Corp.

Yesterday morning, Superior Court Justice Douglas Cunningham gave Smitheman what he had asked for.

After observing that "they have not only engaged in a full-scale occupation of the Clarendon site, they have counselled others to do so as well," and telling those present in the courtroom that "compliance with the orders of this court are not optional," Cunningham ordered Ardoch Algonquin First Nation co-chief Paula Sherman and community spokesman Robert Lovelace jailed for six months.

Cunningham said the sentences could be discharged at any point if the two leaders agreed to purge their contempt. Until then, however, he directed the OPP to take them into custody.

About an hour later, Sherman returned to the courtroom with lawyer Christopher Reid, who represents the Ardoch Algonquins, and Smitheman told the judge that he and Reid had reached "an accommodation" on her behalf that was "motivated on compassionate grounds."

Reid was blunter.

"Ms. Sherman is sole support for three children and she will lose them if she goes to jail," he told judge.

Consequently, she had agreed to enter into an undertaking promising to comply in future with the "letter and spirit" of Cunningham''s Sept. 27 injunction. The injunction requires that Frontenac Ventures have "unfettered and unobstructed access" to its mineral exploration claim - about 30,000 acres of Crown and private land in North Frontenac.

It specifically bars the Algonquin communities living in the area and "persons unknown" from "interfering with, disrupting or hindering" Frontenac Ventures, its employees, agents or contractors. Having agreed on the record to future compliance with the injunction, a process known as purging contempt, Cunningham discharged the custodial portion of his order against Sherman and she was not sent to jail.

At the precise moment she was being dealt with in the second-floor courtroom, however, Lovelace was being placed in the Quinte Detention Centre transport van at the rear of the Frontenac County Court House. Chanting and ululating from a group of supporters, who had gone outside, could be heard faintly through the windows on the north wall of the court.

The sounds of outrage had been much louder, ringing in fact, an hour earlier when Cunningham''s initial pronouncement of sentence was greeted by loud jeers of "Shame! Shame!" from the packed spectators'' gallery. At its peak, a dark-haired woman from among the non-native supporters of the Algonquin leaned across the bar of the court, behind lawyers representing the attorney general, and berated the judge.

"This court is participating in the biggest public health disaster this country has ever seen. Do you understand that?" she yelled up at the judge.

Cunningham paused briefly, but didn''t have her removed. Instead, he continued with sentencing, ordering that Lovelace pay a fine of $25,000, Sherman a fine of $15,000 and the Ardoch Algonquin First Nation $10,000 for past conduct. He set additional fines of $2,000 a day for every day they''re not in compliance in the future and ended by ordering the Ardoch Algonquin statement of defence struck.

They are precluded from bringing any application or motion before him until their contempt is purged.

Reid, putting it in ordinary language after the proceedings ended, said "they are booted out of the court."

What that means in the short term, he said, is that his clients won''t be allowed to mount their core defence in March when they return for a second round in these proceedings.

"The statement of defence," he explained, "challenges the constitutional validity of the Mining Act."

The perversity of the situation, he added, is that his clients are being punished for resorting to direct action instead of relying on the courts. But "they can''t come to court now. Self-help is all that''s left to them now."

At this point, Reid said he''s talking to his clients about an appeal.

Cunningham, in explaining his reasoning for the sentence, said that the adoption of self-help flaunts the rule of law and can''t be tolerated because "respect for our court system evaporates and our entire society suffers as a result."

His sentence, he added, had to send a message to others who might consider similar action.

Respect for the court system wasn''t exactly inspired in the largely partisan crowd of spectators who watched as the two prisoners were taken into custody, however.

After Cunningham rose, those who weren''t attached to Frontenac Ventures or the provincial Ministry of Northern Development and Mines stood en masse and applauded Sherman and Lovelace, some ululating, an expression in sound that can denote sorrow, celebration, honour, defiance or all of them at once.

Gloria Morrison - the wife of Frank Morrison, one of only two non-natives charged in the contempt proceedings - was seething in a quiet and dignified way. Her husband has attended the court case only intermittently when he''s been obliged to but she''s been a fixture since hearings began last summer.

The Morrisons own 100 acres of managed forest and marshland north of Snow Road, property crossed by the Big Antoine and Little Antoine creeks and a man-made stream, which all flow directly into the Mississippi River. They''re opposed to uranium drilling and believe it endangers both the surface and sub-surface waters in the area.

They were devastated when they discovered that Frontenac Ventures had come onto their land without permission sometime in 2006, staked a prospecting claim that covers about 70 per cent of their holding, and that there was nothing they could do about it. According to Frank Morrison, the claim staking alone has destroyed the market value of the property.

It was Gloria Morrison who first alerted the Ardoch Algonquins to the sort of prospecting Frontenac Ventures was doing and asked them to get involved.

She''s unhappy that her husband''s case - like that of Christian Peacemaker David Milne - was severed from the main action against the Ardoch Algonquin earlier this week.

His Ottawa lawyers weren''t provided in advance with essential documents by the Frontenac Ventures legal team, however. Consequently, his case had to be put over to March to allow for proper disclosure.

Gloria Morrison said she''s been disillusioned by what she''s seen since her involvement in this whole thing began.

At 57, she didn''t have any experience with the courts before this, she explained. She had never even experimented with teenage rebellion or hippie culture: "I walked on green lights and picked up garbage off the street. I never smoked and don''t drink."

She admits she had certain expectations about how things were supposed to work for law-abiding citizens. But after witnessing this case unfold, "it has not solved anything," she said. "It''s painful and it has created a situation where many of us will follow."

Unlike Sherman, all of her children are grown and should it come to that, "I am fully able and willing to go to jail," Morrison said, "and no, I would not apologize either for protecting our air and water."

Reid was clearly upset by the outcome of the sentencing.

"I was expecting there would be a period of incarceration. I don''t think anybody expected six months," and described it as "pretty draconian," he said outside the courtroom.

He was also unhappy with Sherman''s predicament and the pressure such a lengthy sentence had imposed on her. "If her kids were now adults, she''d be in jail right now," he said, "but she can''t deprive them of a mother."

As for the fines "you might as well make it $10 million, as far as the ability to pay goes for these people."

Bluntly put, Reid said, "Bob Lovelace is a political prisoner. He''s done nothing violent. He hasn''t hurt anybody. He''s in jail because of his beliefs."', '2008-02-16 13:42:13', '2008-06-12 14:46:58.639891', 0, true, true, true, 'robertlovelace', true);

my hands become cold from warming you<br>
i run them under the hot water as long as i can stand it<br>
and immediately wrap my hands back around you<br>
i want to unleash your scent<br>
your true flavour<br>

i will know your sweet bitterness so much better when you adjust<br>
to the temperature of this room<p>

...dark foam floats upon dark fluid...<br>
sophisticated words to describe you won''t come<br>
but they don''t matter right now<br>
they''ll come later<br>
right now i need to wet my lips<br>
with you<p>

sweet beer â<br>
(sweet mother who art in heaven)<br>
i actually mutter this small impromptu prayer<br>
though i am not a religious man,<br>
i can imagine how it feels to be a trappist monk right now.<br>
worn, warm palms cradle a glass goblet<br>
feeling its cool weight, its patience<br>
its curative properties<br>

vapours drift, rising like patron saints to ancient monastery ceilings<br>
echoing off pipe organ and brass tun<br>
sending clamours between my cheeks like the church bells of grimbergen<br>
i almost need to back away<p>

put you down lest the bitterness and the sweetness overwhelm me<br>
i want to have you â<br>
not just consume you, but have you.<br>
i want you to still be there when i turn around<br>

thank god there are others like you.<br><br><br><b>4. "I Like Beer" by Wayne Carter, address unknown.</b><p>
i like beer<br>
i like it a lot,<br>
i cannot stop<br>
with just a shot.<br>
i drink so much<br>
i soon fall down,<br>
i burp and belch<br>
and feel like a clown.<br>
i feel like crap the very next day<br>
so i lite a cig and down and I.P.A.<br>
i know someday<br>
i''ll have to stop,<br>
but for now just call me,<br>
Pop-a-Top!<br><br><br><b>5. "Untitled" by Erich Renken, address unknown</b><p>

I remember well my first beers<br>
Despite that time''s been 17 years<br>
Bud Light was the brew that night<br>
"Wait a minute, man, there''s something not right"<br>
It''s what I thought when I tasted<br>
That shitty brew which got me wasted<p>

I couldn''t believe that everyone loved beer<p>

But time went on and I drank more<br>
And each time that I woke up on the floor<br>
I grew a little fonder of Busch and Miller<br>
And my empties grew, pillar by pillar<br>
Until one day when I spotted a sale<br>
And bought Sierra Nevada, my first pale ale<p>

I started to see why people loved beer<p>

At first it was bitter, but I persisted<br>
Even when everyone else resisted<br>
There was something about that piney smell<br>
And it went with pizza so damn well<br>
So I made it my own personal quest<br>
To try stouts and porters and all the rest<p>

I began to wonder why people liked Coors<p>

Now I spend wads of money to horde<br>
120 Minutes, Kentucky Breakfasts, and Dark Lord<br>
But my will is weak and I always crack<br>
That good stuff that sits on my rack<br>
And as I drink, my thoughts do flood,<br>

a pint is too easy<br>
to quaff<br>
the wine glass full up with beer is better<br>
to take in<p>

sip after sip<br>
pull after pull<p>

funky earthy sweet bread fills my nose<br>
sticky lace entrances my eyes<br>
earthy tang sweetly coats my tongue<p>', '2008-04-06 16:38:48', '2008-06-12 14:46:58.653129', 0, true, true, true, '2008beerpoetry', true);
